        "text": "Climate change and the outgoing El Ni\u00f1o will likely ignite more weather extremes. by  Umair Irfan The Pacific Ocean \u2014 Earth\u2019s largest body of water \u2014 is an engine for weather around the planet, and it\u2019s about to shift gears this year.\u00a0 The warm phase of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s temperature cycle, known as El Ni\u00f1o, is now winding down and is poised to move into its counterphase, La Ni\u00f1a. During an El Ni\u00f1o year, warm water starts to spread eastward across the surface of the equatorial Pacific. That warm water evaporates readily, adding moisture to the atmosphere and triggering a cascade that alters rainfall, heat waves, and drought patterns across the world.\u00a0 The current El Ni\u00f1o is among the strongest humans have ever experienced.\u00a0 It fueled wildfires, droughts, and floods in South America. It bent the jet stream, trapping heat over the southern United States last summer, and ended the year with the warmest winter on record for much of the country. It fueled both heavy rain and extreme dry conditions in southern Africa, killing crops and putting millions at risk of hunger. It heated the world\u2019s oceans to the highest levels ever measured. It raised global temperatures to their tallest peaks scientists have ever recorded.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe last year has been an amazing year in terms of records set around the world for extreme heat,\u201d said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The periodic swings between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, collectively known as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is a natural phenomenon cycling every three to seven years. Over the past year, the El Ni\u00f1o also synced with other natural patterns like the warm phase of the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s temperature cycle, driving thermometers up further. But humanity\u2019s relentless injection of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere is pushing these changes to greater extremes.\u00a0 Forecasters now expect that warm water across the Pacific to begin retreating westward, heralding a shift to La Ni\u00f1a. McPhaden said one of the most common definitions of La Ni\u00f1a is when surface water temperatures over a large area of the Pacific drop by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius below the historical average for three months or more. El Ni\u00f1o is typically defined when the same region is a half-degree Celsius hotter.\u00a0 NOAA projects an 85 percent chance that the ENSO cycle will shift to its neutral phase between April and June 2024, and then a 60 percent chance a La Ni\u00f1a will develop between June and August 2024. Historically, strong El Ni\u00f1os are followed by short neutral phases, about three to five months, before switching to La Ni\u00f1a. \u201cThe handwriting is on the wall with regard to this La Ni\u00f1a,\u201d McPhaden said. \u201cThe question is exactly when will it come and how strong will it be?\u201d It also takes several months between when ENSO changes and when it starts to influence weather. So the warming impact of the outgoing El Ni\u00f1o is likely to persist and could raise global temperatures this year even higher than they were last year if the rising La Ni\u00f1a is weak or moderate. Heat waves are currently baking Southeast Asia, triggering school closures and health warnings.\u00a0 When La Ni\u00f1a does set in, it will slow and reverse some of the intense weather patterns the world experienced over the past year. But it will also set the stage for more hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. To make this all even more complicated, this is all occurring in a world that\u2019s warmed to the highest levels humans have ever experienced, so it\u2019s not clear yet how far some of these extremes will go.\u00a0 Though they are on opposite sides of a cycle, the effects of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are not quite mirror images of each other. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more complicated than that,\u201d said Pamela Knox, an agricultural climatologist at the University of Georgia Extension.\u00a0 The specific types of weather impacts also vary by region, but looming shifts in the cycle can help forecasters calculate what kinds of heat, rain, and drought conditions are in store in the coming months. For instance, ENSO makes it easier to predict climate variability in the southeastern US, particularly in cooler months. \u201cWe have a pretty strong signal here compared to the central plains,\u201d Knox said.\u00a0 During a La Ni\u00f1a, the cooler waters in the equatorial Pacific soak up heat energy from the atmosphere while air currents deflect the jet stream \u2014\u00a0a narrow, high-altitude band of fast-moving air \u2014 pushing it northward.\u00a0 That air current then tends to box in cold weather to its north in places like Canada and Alaska while trapping moisture in regions like the Pacific Northwest. States like Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina tend to be warmer and drier during La Ni\u00f1a winters, while the Midwest tends to be cloudier, cooler, and wetter. (NOAA has published maps of the globe showing how these patterns typically play out around the world).\u00a0\u00a0 Mickey Glantz, director of the Consortium for Capacity Building at the University of Colorado Boulder, who studies the impacts of ENSO, noted that La Ni\u00f1a doesn\u2019t just shift weather \u2014 it can also intensify existing rain and heat patterns in some regions. \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a, to me, is \u2018extreme normal,\u2019\u201d Glantz said. \u201cYou have a wet season, it\u2019s going to be really wet. If you have a dry season, the probability is it\u2019s going to be really dry.\u201d\u00a0 One of the biggest consequences of a shift to La Ni\u00f1a is the higher likelihood of major hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricanes are built from several ingredients, but two parameters are especially important when it comes to ENSO: water temperature and air stability.\u00a0 The ocean needs to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter to form a hurricane, and the air above it needs to hold steady. El Ni\u00f1o years tend to heat up the Atlantic Ocean, but they also induce wind shear, where air rapidly changes speed and direction in the atmosphere, disrupting tropical storms before they can form. Still, the Atlantic was so abnormally hot last year that it fueled an above-average hurricane season.\u00a0 The Atlantic Ocean is still startlingly hot, but now the looming La Ni\u00f1a is likely to stabilize the air above the sea \u2014 creating a foundation for more hurricanes.\u00a0 The Weather Company and Atmospheric G2 projected that the 2024 hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, would see 24 named storms compared to an average of 14. They projected six hurricanes will reach above Category 3 strength, compared to just three in a typical year.\u00a0 Researchers at Colorado State University expect 23 named storms. University of Pennsylvania scientists anticipate 33 named storms in the Atlantic this year, the highest count ever projected.\u00a0 The added difficulty in predicting how La Ni\u00f1a will play out is that people have heated up the planet. A \u201ccool\u201d La Ni\u00f1a year is now hotter than an El Ni\u00f1o year from 20 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same climate regime that we forecasted the earlier [ENSO cycles] so it\u2019s getting a bit harder to forecast,\u201d Glantz said.\u00a0 How will future climate change in turn affect ENSO? NOAA illustrated the answer with a helpful albeit highly technical schematic (bear with me):\u00a0 The swings between the cool and warm phases of the ENSO are likely to get stronger if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace. So many of the most densely populated parts of the world, like the Andean region in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, are going to experience a more aggressive whiplash between wet and dry years, between calm and stormy summers, and between warmer and cooler winters.\u00a0 For scientists, the rest of 2024 is going to be an important case study in the impacts of climate change and natural variability, sorting out where they diverge, where they intersect, and where they lead to more disasters. The world will be a real-world laboratory, showcasing severe weather that could become more typical as average temperatures continue to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very interesting year,\u201d McPhaden said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see and be ready for more extremes.\u201d\u00a0 You\u2019ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

        "title": "We could be heading into the hottest summer of our lives",
        "text": "High temperatures across the US have the potential to increase risks for drought, wildfires, and hurricanes. by  Li Zhou The United States could be in for another scorcher this summer, per a new study from the National Weather Service (NWS). And that could mean more extreme weather events \u2014 as well as heightened health concerns.\u00a0\u00a0 The NWS outlook, released this month, found that many parts of the US \u2014 including New England and the Southwest \u2014 are likely to have higher than average temperatures from June through August. In recent years, hotter summer temperatures have been driven by climate change and, in some cases, the arrival of a climate pattern known as La Ni\u00f1a, which contributes to drier conditions in certain regions in the US.\u00a0 According to the Weather Channel, there\u2019s a possibility this summer could even wind up being one of the hottest on record, adding to existing milestones.\u00a0 A hotter summer could have serious environmental consequences, including a higher risk of drought, hurricanes, and wildfires in some areas. Additionally, it could pose more health threats to people, with heat-related fatalities \u2014 including those tied to cardiovascular disease \u2014 increasing in the US in the last decade. Broadly, warmer summers have prompted people to take more precautions when it comes to the activities they engage in, become more dependent on resources like air conditioning, and remain on guard for extreme weather events affecting their water supplies and air quality.\u00a0 This summer is expected to be no different, which is why the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the CDC recently rolled out tools aimed at forecasting when extreme heat waves will strike this summer, with the goal of alerting people about these events so they can better prepare for them. Climate change is a major factor in the overall warming that the Earth is experiencing \u2014 including hotter summers, experts say. \u201cThe big obvious player is greenhouse gases that are producing long-term climate change,\u201d William Boos, a UC Berkeley earth and planetary sciences associate professor, told Vox.\u00a0 As a Washington Post analysis found in 2022, the average summer temperature from 2017\u20132021 was 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average US summer temperature from 1971\u20132000, an increase that coincided with record-breaking annual temperatures overall in recent years. The outlook for this year could well make this summer a continuation of that trend.\u00a0 The La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern could also be a contributor to higher heat levels this year if it occurs in the coming months. La Ni\u00f1a is an atmospheric phenomenon involving strong winds that result in cooler temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. The cold water alters the course of high altitude air currents known as the jet stream, which contributes to weather changes.\u00a0 While La Ni\u00f1a can lead to a \u201ccooling down of global temperatures ... it causes changes in wind patterns that can cause some areas to be warmer than normal in summer,\u201d says University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.\u00a0 In the US, the areas that are most likely to see increased temperatures due to La Ni\u00f1a tend to be in the West and South, and that\u2019s poised to be the case this time as well. Higher temperatures in the summer can directly contribute to the proliferation of droughts because heat increases water evaporation and the loss of moisture from plants. Droughts often reduce water supplies for people and animals, and impact the ecosystems of flora and fauna that live in bodies of water as well. According to the National Weather Service, the Southwest, part of the Pacific Northwest, and Hawaii are a few of the regions susceptible to drought this coming summer.\u00a0 A hotter, drier summer season can also increase the likelihood of wildfires in certain areas because it means the ground is drier and the area is more likely to catch fire. When the temperature is warmer, there can be a higher frequency of lightning, too, which can ignite more wildfires.\u00a0 According to projections from the National Interagency Coordination Center, which has published an outlook through July, the Southwest, Mountain West, and Hawaii are similarly areas that are poised to see greater wildfire risk this summer. California, meanwhile, could have a reduced risk compared to past years, in part because of the precipitation it\u2019s experienced this year.\u00a0 In recent years, wildfires have disrupted nearby communities, damaging people\u2019s homes and displacing them, while also affecting people hundreds of miles away. Wildfires in Maui last year \u2014 which were sparked partly because of ongoing drought \u2014 killed around 100 people, and many of those who lost their homes have yet to find new ones. A major wave of wildfires in Canada affected large swaths of the US as well when smoke drifted over and reduced the air quality.\u00a0 [Related: How Maui\u2019s wildfires became so apocalyptic] Higher temperatures could also lead to a more intense hurricane season, according to a group of University of Pennsylvania climate scientists led by Mann. In an analysis published this week, they noted that this Atlantic season could feature the most named hurricanes on record due partly to warmer ocean temperatures. The scientists estimate that there could be anywhere between 27 and 39 named tropical storms, roughly twice as many hurricanes as occur in a standard season.\u00a0 Because evaporation increases when it\u2019s hotter, hurricanes can pick up more moisture from oceans under these circumstances, leading to a higher frequency of more aggressive storms.\u00a0 Generally, higher temperatures also raise worries about health issues and fatalities people may face due to conditions like heat stroke. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes, cities like St. Louis and Philadelphia have seen increases in death rates during heat waves in the past, and hospitals tend to see a spike of admissions related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in these times.\u00a0 Since people\u2019s hearts are under more strain when it\u2019s hot, this puts additional stress on those navigating preexisting health issues as well as vulnerable groups like the young, elderly, and pregnant people. Additionally, people\u2019s standard mechanism for cooling themselves \u2014 sweating \u2014 can be insufficient when it\u2019s especially hot and particularly when there\u2019s high humidity.\u00a0 \u201cIn an average year in the U.S., heat kills more people than any other type of extreme weather,\u201d Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, previously told Scientific American.\u00a0 You\u2019ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

        "Modularized": "Here is the modularized article:\n\nModule 1:\nThe United States could be in for another scorcher this summer, per a new study from the National Weather Service (NWS). And that could mean more extreme weather events \u2014 as well as heightened health concerns. The NWS outlook, released this month, found that many parts of the US \u2014 including New England and the Southwest \u2014 are likely to have higher than average temperatures from June through August.\n\nModule 2:\nIn recent years, hotter summer temperatures have been driven by climate change and, in some cases, the arrival of a climate pattern known as La Ni\u00f1a, which contributes to drier conditions in certain regions in the US. According to the Weather Channel, there\u2019s a possibility this summer could even wind up being one of the hottest on record, adding to existing milestones.\n\nModule 3:\nA hotter summer could have serious environmental consequences, including a higher risk of drought, hurricanes, and wildfires in some areas. Additionally, it could pose more health threats to people, with heat-related fatalities \u2014 including those tied to cardiovascular disease \u2014 increasing in the US in the last decade.\n\nModule 4:\nBroadly, warmer summers have prompted people to take more precautions when it comes to the activities they engage in, become more dependent on resources like air conditioning, and remain on guard for extreme weather events affecting their water supplies and air quality. This summer is expected to be no different, which is why the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the CDC recently rolled out tools aimed at forecasting when extreme heat waves will strike this summer, with the goal of alerting people about these events so they can better prepare for them.\n\nModule 5:\nClimate change is a major factor in the overall warming that the Earth is experiencing \u2014 including hotter summers, experts say. \u201cThe big obvious player is greenhouse gases that are producing long-term climate change,\u201d William Boos, a UC Berkeley earth and planetary sciences associate professor, told Vox. As a Washington Post analysis found in 2022, the average summer temperature from 2017\u20132021 was 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average US summer temperature from 1971\u20132000, an increase that coincided with record-breaking annual temperatures overall in recent years.\n\nModule 6:\nThe La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern could also be a contributor to higher heat levels this year if it occurs in the coming months. La Ni\u00f1a is an atmospheric phenomenon involving strong winds that result in cooler temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. The cold water alters the course of high altitude air currents known as the jet stream, which contributes to weather changes. While La Ni\u00f1a can lead to a \u201ccooling down of global temperatures ... it causes changes in wind patterns that can cause some areas to be warmer than normal in summer,\u201d says University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.\n\nModule 7:\nHigher temperatures in the summer can directly contribute to the proliferation of droughts because heat increases water evaporation and the loss of moisture from plants.

        "text": "An April 9 Instagram video (direct link, archive link) shows a timelapse of satellite images of urban development near the coast in Tulum, Mexico, from 1984 to 2022. While the position of the coastline appears to waver a bit, it does not obviously move inland. \"Shocking NASA footage showing how the sea level has risen in the last 40 years,\" reads the caption. \"All a bloody con this\u00a0#climate\u00a0lark.\" Another version of the claim shared on Instagram garnered more than 220,000 likes in a month. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page Average sea levels have risen worldwide due to global warming, according to research. A satellite image timelapse of one city's coastline is not enough to determine whether or not sea level rise has occurred, experts said. Multiple lines of evidence, including sea level rise, show that Earth's climate is changing. Global warming results in sea level rise because water expands as it warms and melting ice sheets and glaciers increase the amount of water in ocean basins. Tide gauge and satellite data show that average global sea levels have risen 8 to 9 inches since 1880, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. There are several reasons why satellite images of one coastline are not an adequate way to detect this rise, researchers told USA TODAY. First, sea level rise may not obviously change the profile of a given beach if the area is being adequately replenished with sediment, Robert Kopp, a climate change scientist at Rutgers University, told USA TODAY. \"It\u2019s close to a fool\u2019s errand to try to identify sea-level change from landscape-level imagery because sea-level change is just one input into landscape change,\" he said. \"Beaches erode and are replenished from sediment supply all the time. Sea-level rise increases erosion, but if the sediment supply keeps pace, you can still get a steady state profile. It\u2019s the balance between the two that matters.\" Second, depending on different factors, satellite images may not have the resolution to show encroachment, Don Chambers, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida, told USA TODAY. \"Imagery is not used to measure sea level rise,\" he said. Instead, \"we bounce microwave radar signals off the ocean surface from a satellite and deduce the range from the water level to the satellite. We can know the precise location of the satellite above the center of the earth \u2212 to within 1 centimeter vertically using GPS tracking \u2212 and thus determine the height of the water above the center of the earth.\" More: Can we count on renewable energy? Four ways wind, solar and water can power the US Vertical land motion \u2212 land rising or sinking due to geological factors or human behavior \u2212 is yet another reason that images from one beach are inadequate to assess the existence of sea level rise. If land is rising in an area, local sea levels can be falling relative to the land, even while the global average is increasing. \"Sea level rise is also not uniform everywhere because of wind and ocean current patterns,\" Chambers said. \"Sea level along the east coast of the United States is rising a little faster than along the west coast for this reason.\" Tulum doesn't have a tide gauge station, Chambers said. But the closest stations in Progresso, Mexico, and Cape San Antonio, Cuba, have both measured steady sea level rise. Rather than drawing conclusions from images of one stretch of coastline, scientists have determined that Earth's climate is changing by analyzing multiple lines of evidence. For instance, in addition to documenting global sea level rise, multiple climate agencies have detected a long-term rise in global temperatures.

Image source, Joe Gidden/PA Climate change is a major reason the UK suffered such a waterlogged winter, scientists have confirmed. It was the country's second wettest October to March period on record and a disaster for farmers, who faced flooded fields during a key planting period.  Global warming due to humans burning fossil fuels made this level of rainfall at least four times more likely, according to the World Weather Attribution group.  One farmer in Lincolnshire told the BBC that a third of his farm could not be planted in time this year. Colin Chappell, a fourth generation farmer on the banks of the River Ancholme in Lincolnshire, who produces food including peas, oil and wheat, says he will only produce half what he would usually expect. \u201cThere are some farms in the valley that will not see a harvest at all this year. That hasn\u2019t happened here since 1948,\u201d he says. He believes the future for many farmers is bleak. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing to bring in from your fields, what do you sell?\u201d \u201cSupermarkets will just move to imports so the consumer won\u2019t feel the impact of British farms closing down until it\u2019s too late.\u201d The UK and Ireland\u2019s wet winter is the latest in a long line of recent extreme weather events to have been worsened by global warming, as the impacts of climate change begin to hit home. Storms are, of course, a natural part of UK winters, and these low pressure systems are mainly driven by the polar jet stream \u2013 a band of strong winds high up in the atmosphere. But climate scientists have long warned that a warmer planet will bring more intense rainfall in many parts of the world. The air can generally hold around 7% more moisture for every 1C of warming, and the last decade was about 1.2C warmer than pre-industrial times. The scientists modelled what this winter might have been like without climate change and compared it to the reality of our warmer world. They found that the total amount of rainfall between October 2023 and March 2024 would have been a one-in-80-year event without humans heating up the planet, but is now expected once every 20 years. Meanwhile, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days increased by about 20% on average, due to climate change. \u201cUntil the world reduces emissions to net zero, the climate will continue to warm, and rainfall in the UK and Ireland will continue to get heavier,\u201d warns study lead author Sarah Kew, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The struggles faced by UK farmers this winter highlight the urgency and challenges of adapting to more frequent and intense extreme weather through measures like flood defences. Last year, the government\u2019s independent advisers on climate change warned that the UK was \u201cstrikingly unprepared\u201d for its impacts. But adaptation can be far from simple. The reality is that \u201csome of the best farmland is the low-lying land in the UK and you can\u2019t move that elsewhere,\u201d explains Tom Lancaster, head of land, food and farming at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), an independent think tank. You don\u2019t have to be in a flood plain to be impacted by the wet winter as a farmer either, he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s more about soil type. For example waterlogged clay soil stops farmers being able to get machinery onto their fields or drill a crop.\u201d The government\u2019s sustainable farming incentives \u2013 which pay farmers to adopt and maintain sustainable practices - could be a \u201cpotential lifeline for farmers\u201d as the UK continues to face more extreme weather, the ECIU says. Colin Chappell says his farm in Lincolnshire will only make it through by relying on this scheme and a small buffer from previous years.

        "title": "Why the world's oceans are changing colour",
        "text": "The balance of phytoplankton populations in the sea is shifting as a result of human-induced climate change, altering the oceans in profound ways. When you picture the ocean you might imagine sparkling turquoise waters \u2013 but recent research suggests swathes of our world's oceans may in fact be turning greener. And the leading culprit might be climate change.\u00a0 And while some waters are becoming more green, particularly in low latitudes near the equator, others are growing more blue as global temperatures rise. Although this shift in colour isn't visible to the naked eye, satellite studies are able to map the change.\u00a0 \"The colour itself is not something that's easy to describe with human language or that you can even see that well,\" says B B Cael, a scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton in the UK. Instead, this might be something that a mantis shrimp or a butterfly could see, he adds. The recent European State of the Climate report, published in April 2024 by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Service, revealed just how much change is taking place in the ocean. It found that chlorophyll \u2013 a photosythetic pigment found in phytoplankton and plants that gives them their green hue \u2013 were 200-500% higher than average in the Norwegian sea and Altantic Ocean north of the UK in April 2023, while they were 60-80% lower in the ocean west of the Iberian Peninsula. The Mediterranean Sea saw chorophyll levels 50-100% higher than average in June 2023. In both cases the average was taken from measurements between 1998-2020. Scientists believe these shifts in colour go beyond natural year-to-year variations and are a sign of\u00a0warming ocean temperatures.\u00a0(Read about\u00a0the impacts of record ocean heat.) It comes as analysis by BBC News of sea surface temperatures collected by Copernicus has revealed the world's oceans are experiencing record warming. It showed that temperature records were broken in the world's oceans every day over the past year. Cael is the lead author on a recent study published in\u00a0Nature, which mapped two decades of data using Nasa satellites.\u00a0 Alongside scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he found that more than half the world's ocean area \u2013 56% \u2013 changed colour. To put this into perspective, this area is larger than all of the world's landmass. Although scientists aren't sure about the exact causes of these changes, they believe the mass and spread of phytoplankton plays a huge part.\u00a0 Phytoplankton are microscopic, photosynthesising organisms which form the base of the marine food web, sustaining other organisms further up the food chain from krill to whales. They contain chlorophyll, the same green pigment that plants use to harvest energy from sunlight when photosynthesising. Phytoplankton also play a large part in transferring carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean.\u00a0 Typically, the ocean's colour is a result of what lies within its upper layers. In the open ocean, this is the phytoplankton ecosystem. Waters that are deep blue contain less life, while greener waters signal the presence of more phytoplankton.\u00a0 By studying the wavelengths of sunlight reflected off the ocean's surface, scientists can estimate how much chlorophyll is present. \"Different phytoplankton have different combinations of pigments used to photosynthesise. These pigments absorb light at different wavelengths,\" says Cael.\u00a0 \"A glass of water with red food dye looks red because there's something in it that absorbs non-red wavelengths. Phytoplankton, because they are particles in the water, scatter light,\" he adds.\u00a0\u00a0 Modis, an instrument on Nasa's Aqua satellite, takes measurements in seven visible wavelengths, which is a fuller colour spectrum than was captured in previous studies based on computer models. With this, Cael created a model to run simulations. \"We have a virtual Earth where we can have two different versions of history. In one case, we don't have climate change. In the other case, we do,\" he says. To map the spectrum of colour changes, Cael drew from 20 years of data from an instrument onboard Nasa's Aqua satellite, known as the\u00a0Modis (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. Modis takes measurements in seven visible wavelengths, which is a fuller colour spectrum than was captured in previous studies.\u00a0 With this, Cael created a model to run simulations. \"We have a virtual Earth where we can have two different versions of history. In one case, we don't have climate change. In the other case, we do,\" he says.\u00a0 \"We can look at how those two virtual Earths diverge over time and what we see there is something similar to what we're seeing in the real ocean,\" Cael adds.\u00a0\u00a0It was this experiment which discovered that the colours in 56% of the world's oceans had changed. In particular, tropical ocean regions near the Equator have become steadily greener over time, because of the added chlorophyll from increasing phytoplankton.\u00a0 \"We're seeing changes in all the major ocean basins \u2013 it's not confined to just the Pacific or Atlantic or Indian [oceans]. These are really global scale changes that we're seeing,\" says Cael. This confirms a theory in an\u00a0earlier paper\u00a0from Stephanie Dutkiewicz, an oceans scientist in MIT and the\u00a0Center for Global Change Science.  In 2019, Dutkiewicz used computer models to predict future changes in ocean colour. However, it was hard to determine whether this was due to climate change or normal\u00a0 oceanic patterns, such as those observed during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. \"The natural variability is very large. So whether this is increasing or decreasing due to climate change was quite difficult to tell,\" says Dutkiewicz.\u00a0 Cael's study, which added satellite data, widened the scope beyond chlorophyll, looking at different wavelengths, including red and blue, as light bounces off the particles and sediment. Dutkiewicz, who also worked on Cael's study, says the recent paper confirmed her statistical predictions.\u00a0 \"The real-world satellite measurements are consistent with what is seen in the model,\" she says. \"So by inference, the changes we're seeing in the real world are very likely due to human-induced changes to the climate.\" The impact these changes will have on the ocean are likely to be dramatic. Some researchers have predicted that phytoplankton will shift north at a speed of around 35km (21 miles) each decade as tempteruares continue to warm. This will lead to changes in the distribution of zooplankton \u2013 the tiny animals that feed on the phytoplankton \u2013 too, with species richness expected to decline in the tropics and increase dramatically in temperate and subpolar waters, leading to further knock on effects in the interconnected food webs and fish that rely upon these creatures. Emerald coves and deep blue open stretches of sea won't suddenly change colour overnight. But the changes reveal a trend that may increase as temperatures warm.\u00a0 \"It's not really the colour itself that we care about,\" says Cael. \"What matters is the change in colour reflects the change in the ecosystem.\"\u00a0 -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0 Marc Cieslak finds out how gentoo penguins are adapting to a warming climate.

It was this experiment which discovered that the colours in 56% of the world's oceans had changed. In particular, tropical ocean regions near the Equator have become steadily greener over time, because of the added chlorophyll from increasing phytoplankton.  \"We're seeing changes in all the major ocean basins \u2013 it's not confined to just the Pacific or Atlantic or Indian [oceans]. These are really global scale changes that we're seeing,\" says Cael. This confirms a theory in an  earlier paper  from Stephanie Dutkiewicz, an oceans scientist in MIT and the  Center for Global Change Science.  In 2019, Dutkiewicz used computer models to predict future changes in ocean colour. However, it was hard to determine whether this was due to climate change or normal  oceanic patterns, such as those observed during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. \"The natural variability is very large. So whether this is increasing or decreasing due to climate change was quite difficult to tell,\" says Dutkiewicz.  Cael's study, which added satellite data, widened the scope beyond chlorophyll, looking at different wavelengths, including red and blue, as light bounces off the particles and sediment. Dutkiewicz, who also worked on Cael's study, says the recent paper confirmed her statistical predictions.  \"The real-world satellite measurements are consistent with what is seen in the model,\" she says. \"So by inference, the changes we're seeing in the real world are very likely due to human-induced changes to the climate.\" The impact these changes will have on the ocean are likely to be dramatic. Some researchers have predicted that phytoplankton will shift north at a speed of around 35km (21 miles) each decade as tempteruares continue to warm. This will lead to changes in the distribution of zooplankton \u2013 the tiny animals that feed on the phytoplankton \u2013 too, with species richness expected to decline in the tropics and increase dramatically in temperate and subpolar waters, leading to further knock on effects in the interconnected food webs and fish that rely upon these creatures. Emerald coves and deep blue open stretches of sea won't suddenly change colour overnight. But the changes reveal a trend that may increase as temperatures warm.  \"It's not really the colour itself that we care about,\" says Cael. \"What matters is the change in colour reflects the change in the ecosystem.\""

        "text": " There\u2019s no silver bullet to address climate change, but experts are finding some solutions that are extraordinarily effective at mitigating environmental shifts. One game changer, according to leading mycologist Paul Stamets, is the humble mushroom. In this BBC StoryWorks chapter of the Climate Academy by Grounded, a digital series featuring some of the world\u2019s leading climate solutionists, Stamets\u2014mycologist, speaker, author, medical researcher and founder of Fungi Perfecti\u2014discusses the deep impact that the mycelium, or the vast root systems of mushrooms, can have on the climate. The mycelium, which extends more than 300 miles down into the earth, is excellent at taking in and breaking down hydrocarbons. That ability gives it several crucial roles in the forest ecosystem. First, it can break down toxins, making it a protective force for the soil and plants around it. Mycelium also sequesters a great deal of carbon, which keeps climate-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere (some fungi can store 70 percent more carbon in the soil!). Furthermore, the mycelium is able to break some of that stored carbon down into carbohydrates, which then act as nutrients for the soil. Those rich soils in turn welcome a greater variety of plant and animal life, and because ecosystems work together to protect the Earth from environmental harm, greater biodiversity makes for a more ecologically secure planet. Plant diversity also helps improve carbon sequestration: soil can hold two to three times more carbon when it hosts diverse plant life. To protect the planet and ourselves, it\u2019s crucial to encourage biodiversity through the creation of rich soils, and one easy way to do that is simply allowing fungi to grow. That means embracing decomposition\u2014allowing dead trees to rot instead of removing them, for example\u2014a low-lift solution leaving nature to its own devices. \u201cSolutions are right underneath our feet,\u201d says Stamets. Don\u2019t forget to look down. There's no silver bullet to address climate change, but mycelium, or the vast root systems of mushrooms, can be a game-changing environmental solution\u2014with benefits for human health and prosperity. Grounded is a philanthropic organization dedicated to the amplification of climate solutions to ensure a livable planet. By shining a spotlight on climate solutions that harness nature and human ingenuity, they demonstrate how the climate crisis can, and should be reversed by 2030.",

        "title": "Deserts, explained",
        "text": "Deserts may seem lifeless, but in fact many species have evolved special ways to survive in the harsh environments. Far from being barren wastelands, deserts are biologically rich habitats with a vast array of animals and plants that have adapted to the harsh conditions there. Some deserts are among the planet's last remaining areas of total wilderness. Yet more than one billion people, one-sixth of the Earth's population, actually live in desert regions. Deserts cover more than one-fifth of the Earth's land area, and they are found on every continent. A place that receives less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain per year is considered a desert. Deserts are part of a wider class of regions called drylands. These areas exist under a \u201cmoisture deficit,\u201d which means they can frequently lose more moisture through evaporation than they receive from annual precipitation. Despite the common conceptions of deserts as hot, there are cold deserts as well. The largest hot desert in the world, northern Africa's Sahara, reaches temperatures of up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) during the day. But some deserts are always cold, like the Gobi desert in Asia and the polar deserts of the Antarctic and Arctic, which are the world's largest. Others are mountainous. Only about 20 percent of deserts are covered by sand. The driest deserts, such as Chile's Atacama Desert, have parts that receive less than .08 inches (2 mm) of precipitation a year. Such environments are so harsh and otherworldly that scientists have even studied them for clues about life on Mars. On the other hand, every few years, an unusually rainy period can produce \"super blooms,\" where even the Atacama becomes blanketed in wildflowers. Desert animals have evolved ways to help them keep cool and use less water. Camels can go for weeks without water, and their nostrils and eyelashes can form a barrier against sand. Many desert animals, such as the fennec fox, are nocturnal, coming out to hunt only when the brutal sun has descended. Some animals, like the desert tortoise in the southwestern United States, spend much of their time underground. Most desert birds are nomadic, crisscrossing the skies in search of food. And among insects, the Namibian desert beetle can harvest fog from the air for water. Because of their very special adaptations, desert animals are extremely vulnerable to changes in their habitat. Desert plants may have to go without fresh water for years at a time. Some plants have adapted to the arid climate by growing long roots that tap water from deep underground. Other plants, such as cacti, have special means of storing and conserving water. Some of the world's semi-arid regions are turning into desert at an alarming rate. This process, known as desertification, is not caused by drought, but usually arises from deforestation and the demands of human populations that settle on the semi-arid lands. The pounding of the soil by the hooves of livestock in ranching, for example, may degrade the soil and encourage erosion by wind and water. In northern China, growing urbanization, which left much of the land unprotected against wind erosion and the buildup of sediment from the surrounding desert, created a desertification problem, prompting the government to build a \"great green wall\" as a hedge against encroaching desert. In existing deserts, some species are in peril because of climate change. Global warming threatens to change the ecology of deserts: Higher temperatures may produce more wildfires that alter desert landscapes by eliminating slow-growing trees and shrubs and replacing them with fast-growing grasses. Many desert plants can live for hundreds of years. But in California, the iconic Joshua tree\u2014the oldest found was 1,000 years old\u2014may not survive a hotter climate, scientists warn. If they don't survive, that could affect species such as the yucca moth, which lays its eggs inside the Joshua tree flower. Desert bird species could also be in danger from climate change, as heat waves lead to lethal dehydration. Paradoxically, the effort to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by expanding solar energy has also created some tensions for desert habitats. In the Mojave, the 2013 arrival of the Ivanpah solar thermal plant created concerns about how the facility would affect threatened desert tortoises, and conservationists are working to ensure solar energy projects like these can coexist with wildlife. Other land use changes also threaten to degrade desert habitats. The downsizing of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument poses a threat to some of the 660 bee species that live in the area, while the prospect of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico could disconnect a third of 346 native wildlife species from 50 percent or more of their range that lies south of the border, including the desert bighorn sheep.

        "title": "Extreme Research Shows How Arctic Ice Is Dwindling",
        "text": "Premium Content What happens when the planet loses some of its ability to cool itself? The sea ice that blankets the Arctic Ocean isn\u2019t the unbroken white mantle depicted in maps. It\u2019s a jigsaw puzzle of restless floes that are constantly colliding, deforming, and fracturing from the force of wind and ocean currents. Last February I stood shivering on the deck of the Lance, an old Norwegian research vessel, as it picked a path through a labyrinth of navigable fractures. A barren white plain of ice and snow extended to the horizon in every direction. The ship\u2019s steel hull shuddered and screeched as it plowed through floating chunks of jagged ice. The Lance was seeking a solid patch of ice to attach to\u2014the last one had shattered\u2014so that it could resume its erratic drift across the frozen sea, charting the fate of Arctic sea ice by going with the floe. The Norwegians have done this before, more than a century ago, when polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen and the Fram were locked in pack ice for nearly three years during a vain attempt to drift across the North Pole. But the Arctic is a different ocean now. The air above it has warmed on average about 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century, more than twice the global average. Much less of the ocean is covered by ice, and much more of that ice is thinner, seasonal ice rather than thick, old floes. A feedback loop with far-reaching consequences has taken effect: As white ice is replaced in summer by dark ocean water, which absorbs more sunlight, the water and air heat further\u2014amplifying the ongoing thaw. \u201cThe Arctic warms first, most, and fastest,\u201d explains Kim Holm\u00e9n, the long-bearded international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI), which operates theLance. Climate models predict that by as early as 2040 it will be possible in summer to sail across open water to the North Pole. Arctic sea ice helps cool the whole planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. So its loss inevitably will affect the climate and weather beyond the Arctic, but precisely how remains unclear. Better forecasts require better data on sea ice and its shifting, uneven distribution. \u201cMost scientific cruises to the Arctic are conducted in summer, and this is where we have the most field data,\u201d says Gunnar Spreen, an NPI sea-ice physicist I met on board the Lance. \u201cThe continuous changes that occur from winter into spring are a huge gap in our understanding.\u201d On the Lance\u2019s five-month mission its rotating crew of international scientists would investigate the causes and effects of ice loss by monitoring the ice across its entire seasonal life cycle\u2014from the time when it formed in winter until it melted in summer. A few days after photographer Nick Cobbing and I joined the ship by icebreaker and helicopter from Longyearbyen, on the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago\u2014the base for NPI\u2019s Arctic operations\u2014the Lance steamed to 83 degrees north, just west of Russian territory. The scientists singled out a half-mile-wide floe of predominantly seasonal ice that they hoped to study. The crew tethered the vessel to the floe with nylon ropes attached to thick metal poles driven into the ice. They shut off the main engine. Isolated and in near darkness, we began our wayward drift and our month-long shift in the ice desert. Like homesteaders, the scientists established camps on the floe, pitching tents and laying electric cables. Physicists like Spreen mapped the ice topography with lasers and recorded the thickness and temperature of the snow on top. Oceanographers bored a hole through the ice to gather data about the water and the currents. Meteorologists erected masts carrying instruments to collect weather data and measure greenhouse gases. Biologists searched for ice algae, which look like dirt and live on the underside of the ice and in the channels of trapped brine left after newly formed sea ice expels salt. In a few weeks, after the returning sun cast aside the cloak of polar night and began filtering through the melting floe, the scientists would watch the ecosystem awaken.   Temperatures regularly plunged to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Scientists had to contend with numb fingers, snapped cables, and crippled electronic instruments, along with the danger of roving polar bears. \u201cThis is really extreme science,\u201d one researcher said. In 2007 the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the impacts of climate change in the Arctic over the next century \u201cwill exceed the impacts forecast for many other regions and will produce feedbacks that will have globally significant consequences.\u201d Nearly a decade later this grim forecast is already being borne out. Probably no region has been more affected by climate change than the Arctic. Permafrost is thawing, and the land is greening, as tree lines creep north and shrubs and grasses invade the tundra. Certain populations of polar bears, walruses, and caribou have suffered significant declines. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) oceanographer James Overland says, \u201cThe Arctic really is the canary showing that climate change is real.\u201d Since 1979, when satellite records began, the Arctic has lost more than half its volume of ice, which has diminished in both overall area and thickness. The frozen area shrinks to its annual minimum in September, at summer\u2019s end. In September 2012 its extent was just half the average during the 1980s and \u201990s. The maximum ice extent in winter, usually reached in March, also is declining, though at a slower rate; its average thickness has decreased by half. What was once mostly a layer of 10- to 13-foot-thick ice floes that lingered for years\u2014perennial ice\u2014has given way to large tracts of thinner, less reflective ice that forms and melts during a single year. Sea-ice coverage has always fluctuated naturally, but there\u2019s little doubt among scientists that man-made greenhouse gases are now accelerating its decline. \u201cOld, thick sea ice was a global reservoir for cold, but that is now changing,\u201d Overland says. An entire ecosystem is melting away. The loss of sea ice may take a toll on some of the photosynthesizing organisms that fuel the marine food chain\u2014single-celled algae that live under the ice and bloom in the spring when the light returns. Changes in the magnitude and timing of these blooms, as winter ice retreats faster and earlier, may throw off the life cycle of tiny, fatty zooplankton called copepods, which eat the algae and are in turn eaten by arctic cod, seabirds, and bowhead whales. For marine mammals such as the polar bear, Pacific walrus, and ringed seal, the loss of hundreds of thousands of square miles of sea ice has already been devastating. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone took the floor out from under you,\u201d says Kristin Laidre, a polar scientist at the University of Washington. The assumption is that later this century, without a home field, these animals will simply lose all competitive advantage. Killer whales, for example, are likely to replace polar bears as the top marine predators, as bears retreat to the dwindling remnants of summer sea ice. Though polar bears sometimes spend time on land, where lately a few have been hybridizing with grizzlies, Ian Stirling of the University of Alberta, a leading polar bear expert, dismisses any notion that they could survive long-term on land as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Ice-free conditions are likely to draw in other competitors\u2014zooplankton (maybe less fatty and nutritious ones), fish, seals\u2014from more temperate waters. Ice loss is also making the Arctic even more vulnerable to ocean acidification, another effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. Cold water absorbs more CO\u2082 than warm water does, and more cold water is now open to the air. As the water acidifies, it loses carbonate. Within the next 15 years it may no longer contain enough for animals such as sea snails and Alaska king crabs to construct and maintain their calcium-carbonate shells. The upshot of all this, as Stirling bluntly puts it: \u201cThe Arctic marine ecosystem as we know it now will no longer exist.\u201d Warmer air above the ocean basin is projected to spill down over the surrounding coasts of Russia, Alaska, and Canada, causing feedback effects as far as 900 miles inland, including accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet and large emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from thawing tundra. IPCC models forecast that the total loss of summer sea ice may in itself cause one-third of the warming of the Northern Hemisphere and 14 percent of total global warming by the end of the century. How a rapidly warming Arctic will influence weather across the hemisphere is a bit hazier. Atmospheric scientists Jennifer Francis at Rutgers University and Steve Vavrus at the University of Wisconsin have suggested that people in the continental United States already may be feeling the effects of melting Arctic sea ice\u2014especially in the past two winters in the east, which made \u201cpolar vortex\u201d household words. The polar vortex is the mass of cold air that\u2019s normally confined over the Pole by the polar jet stream\u2014the high-altitude, fast-moving torrent of air that snakes around the Pole from west to east. The jet stream draws most of its energy from the contrast in temperature and pressure between the frigid air to its north and the warmer air to the south. As sea-ice loss amplifies the warming in the Arctic, the Francis theory goes, that contrast is reduced, weakening the jet stream\u2019s westerly winds. It becomes a lazier, more sinuous river, with large meanders that extend far to the south and north. Because the meanders advance slowly across the map, whatever weather they enfold persists for a long time. During the past two winters the wavier pattern allowed Arctic air and extreme snow to beset New England and drought to linger over California. The melting Arctic may be affecting weather elsewhere too. Korean researchers have linked extreme winters in East Asia to air-circulation changes caused specifically by ice loss in the Barents-Kara Sea. It\u2019s a neat theory, but parts of it remain \u201cfuzzy,\u201d Francis admits. Also, many researchers who study atmospheric dynamics aren\u2019t buying it. A more plausible explanation for the wavier jet stream and the southward excursions of the polar vortex, some of them argue, is the influence of the tropical Pacific, which is a far more powerful source of heat than the Arctic. It will take years of data gathering and modeling to settle the debate. In any case, as the warming of the planet continues, cold spells of any kind will become less common. Even if sharp limits on greenhouse gas emissions are adopted over the next 20 years, the decline of sea ice will continue for decades. \u201cWe\u2019re on a one-way trip and not going back,\u201d says Overland. A further rise of 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic is all but assured by mid-century, he says, enough to keep the ocean ice free for at least two months of the year, enough to change the seasons there\u2014\u201cenough to affect everything.\u201d In late June, during the final phase of their expedition, the scientists aboard the Lance awoke to discover that the latest ice floe they\u2019d attached to was disintegrating too. They scrambled to salvage their gear before it became flotsam. It was time to pack up anyway. The vessel by that point had spent 111 days in the ice, tethered to different floes for several weeks at a time\u2014logging altogether some 4,000 nautical miles across the Arctic. Polar bears had crossed its path, sometimes pausing to play with the scientists\u2019 strange-looking electronic instruments. Storms had bulldozed huge blocks of ice high against the ship, elevating it above the surface. The Lance\u2019s crew had bested the researchers in a soccer match on the floe. Over the next couple of years the 68 scientists involved will be hunkered in their warm labs, making sense of all the data they gathered. One morning in March, under a dusky blue sky, I had joined Gunnar Spreen and another NPI researcher, Anja R\u00f6sel, on one of their periodic forays to measure changes in the ice floe\u2019s thickness. We each wore insulated armor\u2014jumpsuit, balaclava, goggles, gloves, mittens over the gloves. The scientists brought along a snow-depth probe, a GPS device, and an orange plastic sled carrying the ice-thickness instrument, which works by inducing an electric current in the seawater below. I carried a flare gun and a .30-06-caliber rifle: bear protection. Following a mile-long path staked by bamboo poles, we trudged over dunelike snowdrifts and pressure ridges\u2014slabs of sea ice pushed up by colliding floes\u2014that looked like crumbling stone walls. Every few feet Spreen stopped and plunged the depth gauge into the snowpack until it beeped to indicate that the measurement was complete. Arctic warming seemed an abstract concept that day\u2014I couldn\u2019t really feel my toes\u2014but across the icescape, Spreen saw evidence of change. \u201cThis is an unusual amount of snow,\u201d he noted. Two feet of it lay beneath our moon boots, twice the amount in a typical year. One data point doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this one was consistent with model forecasts: As sea ice shrinks, the extra heat and water vapor released from the open water into the lower atmosphere should generate more precipitation. More snow falling on a glacier on land would be a good thing, because that\u2019s how glaciers grow\u2014by accumulating layers of snow so thick that the stuff at the bottom gets compressed into ice. But sea ice forms when cold air freezes seawater, and snow falling on top of it acts as an insulating blanket that slows the growth of the ice. As it happened, two weeks after my walk with Spreen, the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado announced that Arctic sea ice had already reached its maximum extent for the winter in late February\u2014much earlier than usual. It was the lowest maximum the satellites had ever recorded. Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved",

        "Modularized": "Here is the modularized article:\n\nModule 1:\nThe sea ice that blankets the Arctic Ocean isn\u2019t the unbroken white mantle depicted in maps. It\u2019s a jigsaw puzzle of restless floes that are constantly colliding, deforming, and fracturing from the force of wind and ocean currents. Last February I stood shivering on the deck of the Lance, an old Norwegian research vessel, as it picked a path through a labyrinth of navigable fractures. A barren white plain of ice and snow extended to the horizon in every direction.\n\nModule 2:\nThe Lance was seeking a solid patch of ice to attach to\u2014the last one had shattered\u2014so that it could resume its erratic drift across the frozen sea, charting the fate of Arctic sea ice by going with the floe. The Norwegians have done this before, more than a century ago, when polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen and the Fram were locked in pack ice for nearly three years during a vain attempt to drift across the North Pole. But the Arctic is a different ocean now.\n\nModule 3:\nThe air above it has warmed on average about 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century, more than twice the global average. Much less of the ocean is covered by ice, and much more of that ice is thinner, seasonal ice rather than thick, old floes. A feedback loop with far-reaching consequences has taken effect: As white ice is replaced in summer by dark ocean water, which absorbs more sunlight, the water and air heat further\u2014amplifying the ongoing thaw.\n\nModule 4:\n\u201cThe Arctic warms first, most, and fastest,\u201d explains Kim Holm\u00e9n, the long-bearded international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI), which operates the Lance. Climate models predict that by as early as 2040 it will be possible in summer to sail across open water to the North Pole. Arctic sea ice helps cool the whole planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. So its loss inevitably will affect the climate and weather beyond the Arctic, but precisely how remains unclear.\n\nModule 5:\nBetter forecasts require better data on sea ice and its shifting, uneven distribution. \u201cMost scientific cruises to the Arctic are conducted in summer, and this is where we have the most field data,\u201d says Gunnar Spreen, an NPI sea-ice physicist I met on board the Lance. \u201cThe continuous changes that occur from winter into spring are a huge gap in our understanding.\u201d\n\nModule 6:\nOn the Lance\u2019s five-month mission its rotating crew of international scientists would investigate the causes and effects of ice loss by monitoring the ice across its entire seasonal life cycle\u2014from the time when it formed in winter until it melted in summer. A few days after photographer Nick Cobbing and I joined the ship by icebreaker and helicopter from Longyearbyen, on the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago\u2014the base for NPI\u2019s Arctic operations\u2014the Lance steamed to 83 degrees north, just west of Russian territory.\n\nModule 7:\nThe scientists singled out a half-mile-wide floe of predominantly seasonal ice that they hoped to study. The crew tethered the vessel to the floe with nylon ropes attached to thick metal poles driven into the ice. They shut off the main engine. Isolated and in near darkness, we began our wayward drift and our month-long shift in the ice desert.\n\nModule 8:\nLike homesteaders, the scientists established camps on the floe, pitching tents and laying electric cables. Physicists like Spreen mapped the ice topography with lasers and recorded the thickness and temperature of the snow on top. Oceanographers bored a hole through the ice to gather data about the water and the currents. Meteorologists erected masts carrying instruments to collect weather data and measure greenhouse gases. Biologists searched for ice algae, which look like dirt and live on the underside of the ice and in the channels of trapped brine left after newly formed sea ice expels salt.\n\nModule 9:\nIn 2007 the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the impacts of climate change in the Arctic over the next century \u201cwill exceed the impacts forecast for many other regions and will produce feedbacks that will have globally significant consequences.\u201d Nearly a decade later this grim forecast is already being borne out. Probably no region has been more affected by climate change than the Arctic.\n\nModule 10:\nPermafrost is thawing, and the land is greening, as tree lines creep north and shrubs and grasses invade the tundra. Certain populations of polar bears, walruses, and caribou have suffered significant declines. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) oceanographer James Overland says, \u201cThe Arctic really is the canary showing that climate change is real.\u201d\n\nModule 11:\nSince 1979, when satellite records began, the Arctic has lost more than half its volume of ice, which has diminished in both overall area and thickness. The frozen area shrinks to its annual minimum in September, at summer\u2019s end. In September 2012 its extent was just half the average during the 1980s and \u201990s. The maximum ice extent in winter, usually reached in March, also is declining, though at a slower rate; its average thickness has decreased by half.\n\nModule 12:\nWhat was once mostly a layer of 10- to 13-foot-thick ice floes that lingered for years\u2014perennial ice\u2014has given way to large tracts of thinner, less reflective ice that forms and melts during a single year. Sea-ice coverage has always fluctuated naturally, but there\u2019s little doubt among scientists that man-made greenhouse gases are now accelerating its decline.\n\nModule 13:\n\u201cOld, thick sea ice was a global reservoir for cold, but that is now changing,\u201d Overland says. An entire ecosystem is melting away. The loss of sea ice may take a toll on some of the photosynthesizing organisms that fuel the marine food chain\u2014single-celled algae that live under the ice and bloom in the spring when the light returns.\n\nModule 14:\nChanges in the magnitude and timing of these blooms, as winter ice retreats faster and earlier, may throw off the life cycle of tiny, fatty zooplankton called copepods, which eat the algae and are in turn eaten by arctic cod, seabirds, and bowhead whales. For marine mammals such as the polar bear, Pacific walrus, and ringed seal, the loss of hundreds of thousands of square miles of sea ice has already been devastating.\n\nModule 15:\n\u201cIt\u2019s like someone took the floor out from under you,\u201d says Kristin Laidre, a polar scientist at the University of Washington. The assumption is that later this century, without a home field, these animals will simply lose all competitive advantage. Killer whales, for example, are likely to replace polar bears as the top marine predators, as bears retreat to the dwindling remnants of summer sea ice.\n\nModule 16:\nThough polar bears sometimes spend time on land, where lately a few have been hybridizing with grizzlies, Ian Stirling of the University of Alberta, a leading polar bear expert, dismisses any notion that they could survive long-term on land as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Ice-free conditions are likely to draw in other competitors\u2014zooplankton (maybe less fatty and nutritious ones), fish, seals\u2014from more temperate waters.\n\nModule 17:\nIce loss is also making the Arctic even more vulnerable to ocean acidification, another effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. Cold water absorbs more CO\u2082 than warm water does, and more cold water is now open to the air. As the water acidifies, it loses carbonate. Within the next 15 years it may no longer contain enough for animals such as sea snails and Alaska king crabs to construct and maintain their calcium-carbonate shells.\n\nModule 18:\nThe upshot of all this, as Stirling bluntly puts it: \u201cThe Arctic marine ecosystem as we know it now will no longer exist.\u201d Warmer air above the ocean basin is projected to spill down over the surrounding coasts of Russia, Alaska, and Canada, causing feedback effects as far as 900 miles inland, including accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet and large emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from thawing tundra.\n\nModule 19:\nIPCC models forecast that the total loss of summer sea ice may in itself cause one-third of the warming of the Northern Hemisphere and 14 percent of total global warming by the end of the century. How a rapidly warming Arctic will influence weather across the hemisphere is a bit hazier.\n\nModule 20:\nAtmospheric scientists Jennifer Francis at Rutgers University and Steve Vavrus at the University of Wisconsin have suggested that people in the continental United States already may be feeling the effects of melting Arctic sea ice\u2014especially in the past two winters in the east, which made \u201cpolar vortex\u201d household words.\n\nModule 21:\nThe polar vortex is the mass of cold air that\u2019s normally confined over the Pole by the polar jet stream\u2014the high-altitude, fast-moving torrent of air that snakes around the Pole from west to east.

One morning in March, under a dusky blue sky, I had joined Gunnar Spreen and another NPI researcher, Anja R\u00f6sel, on one of their periodic forays to measure changes in the ice floe\u2019s thickness. We each wore insulated armor\u2014jumpsuit, balaclava, goggles, gloves, mittens over the gloves.\n\nThe scientists brought along a snow-depth probe, a GPS device, and an orange plastic sled carrying the ice-thickness instrument, which works by inducing an electric current in the seawater below. I carried a flare gun and a .30-06-caliber rifle: bear protection. Following a mile-long path staked by bamboo poles, we trudged over dunelike snowdrifts and pressure ridges\u2014slabs of sea ice pushed up by colliding floes\u2014that looked like crumbling stone walls.\n\nEvery few feet Spreen stopped and plunged the depth gauge into the snowpack until it beeped to indicate that the measurement was complete. Arctic warming seemed an abstract concept that day\u2014I couldn\u2019t really feel my toes\u2014but across the icescape, Spreen saw evidence of change. \u201cThis is an unusual amount of snow,\u201d he noted. Two feet of it lay beneath our moon boots, twice the amount in a typical year.\n\nOne data point doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this one was consistent with model forecasts: As sea ice shrinks, the extra heat and water vapor released from the open water into the lower atmosphere should generate more precipitation. More snow falling on a glacier on land would be a good thing, because that\u2019s how glaciers grow\u2014by accumulating layers of snow so thick that the stuff at the bottom gets compressed into ice.\n\nBut sea ice forms when cold air freezes seawater, and snow falling on top of it acts as an insulating blanket that slows the growth of the ice. As it happened, two weeks after my walk with Spreen, the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado announced that Arctic sea ice had already reached its maximum extent for the winter in late February\u2014much earlier than usual. It was the lowest maximum the satellites had ever recorded."

        "title": "Aircraft turbulence is worsening with climate change. Studying birds could help",
        "text": "Our skies are getting bumpier, making the need to understand and predict turbulence increasingly urgent. Researchers propose birds could provide clues. When you look up, the sky may seem calm \u2013 still even \u2013 but air is always on the move. Fluid, it flows like water, with eddies and currents, sometimes smooth and serene, sometimes tumultuous and violent. Turbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena. And research shows that severe turbulence is becoming more likely as the planet warms. If an aircraft strikes it, the most turbulent air can cause injuries or even death, as well as structural damage to planes. On Tuesday, a Singapore Airlines flight from London encountered severe turbulence: 31 people were injured, and one died. Passengers aboard the Boeing 777-300ER told the BBC the plane began to tilt and shake, before dropping suddenly, and \"people and objects were thrown around the cabin\". Could there be better ways to predict and cope with turbulence? Some researchers believe that answers lie in the animal world. Birds often encounter choppy skies. While only a few species reach the height of a cruising commercial aircraft, studying how they respond at lower altitudes could help meteorologists build better models to predict turbulence, says Emily Shepard, an expert in bird flight and air flow at Swansea University in Wales. And that's not all we could learn from our avian friends: some species have adapted to deal with \"extreme turbulence\", she says. Analysing how they exploit it to their advantage could inform aircraft design, especially in urban environments where smaller aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fly. According to a 2024 study, aircrafts encounter moderate to \"severe-or-greater\" turbulence 68,000 times every year. Turbulence is defined as \"an irregular motion of the air\" caused by eddies and vertical currents, and is associated with weather events such as fronts, wind shear and thunderstorms. Turbulence can cause a few uncomfortable bumps \u2013 or throw an aircraft out of control, inducing \"chaotic rolls, pitches and yaws\". Modern aircraft are equipped with sophisticated weather radar systems that pilots use to identify and navigate around areas of turbulence. \"We can successfully predict around 75% of turbulence up to 18 hours ahead,\" says Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading. However, there are many types of turbulence \u2013 and some can be harder to spot. The severe turbulence that struck the Singapore Airlines flight is often caused by invisible \"clear air turbulence\". This can strike without warning, and is one of the biggest causes of weather-related aviation accidents. Clear air turbulence occurs at high altitudes, where aircraft cruise in seemingly calm blue skies. It can't be seen by the naked eye and is undetectable by onboard sensors. Even satellites can't see this kind of turbulence, only the structure and shape of the jet stream which may hint at its presence. Pilots often have to rely on any aircraft flying the same path ahead of them of them to report clear air turbulence, so they can adjust their path. Climate change is making clear air turbulence more common, says Williams, who has studied the rise. \"In simple terms, climate change is increasing the temperature difference between the warm and cold air masses that collide to form the jet stream in the upper atmosphere,\" he says. \"This effect is making the jet stream less stable and allowing more turbulence to break out.\" Meteorologists are now seeking to develop better methods of forecasting all types of turbulence, using computer modelling. However, one source of data that's gone untapped until recently are the creatures we share the skies with: birds. Previous studies have shown that animal movements can help us determine the strength of thermal updrafts, wind direction and wind speed. Now researchers from Swansea University say birds' experience of the winds could help provide predictions of turbulence. Birds often migrate for thousands of miles \u2013 with wind speed, direction and turbulence all dictating the route they travel and the amount of energy they have to expend. And when you're running on reserves at the end of an epic trip half way around the world, catching the wrong winds can mean the difference between life and death. While most species don't fly alongside cruising commercial jets, some get extremely high. Take frigate birds, for example. Their flight is a \"roller-coaster\", says Shepard. They rely on thermals and wind to stay aloft for months one end and can fly at extreme altitudes, as high as 13,000ft (4km/2.5 miles) above the ground. To reach this great height, they often catch strong updrafts in mountainous cumulus clouds. \"They gain altitude within these really, really turbulent cloud systems,\" says Shepard. \"You get monstrous updrafts and downdrafts. They are operating in incredibly turbulent environments \u2013 and we know so little about how they are able to maintain flight control.\" By studying how such birds respond to turbulence, Shepard and her colleaues at Swansea University's Laboratory for Animal Movement aim to \"visualise the invisible\", and to map what the air is doing. Sometimes that even involves flying alongside the birds. From 2018 to 2019, Shepard's team flew an ultralight aircraft alongside a flock of homing pigeons. Using GPS, barometric pressure and acceleration data loggers attached to the birds \u2013 over 88 flights \u2013 they measured the turbulence levels during the journeys the birds took to return to their lofts. \"You're pretty exposed up there,\" says Shepard. \"You're open to the elements. It's a very direct experience.\" The team flew in a variety of conditions; early morning when there was little ground heat to cause bumpy convective currents, later in the day when the thermals were stronger, and at different times of year. \"There were several occasions when the pilot was forced to land or decided he wasn't going to fly again that morning, because the turbulence was so strong and it was affecting his ability to maintain flight control. It was too bumpy for him,\" says Shepard. \"But the pigeons returned to the loft with no problem. So, pigeons can deal with high levels of turbulence \u2013 more so than the ultralight. They clearly have mechanisms of coping with this turbulence.\" The Swansea University research suggests the possibility of using bird-borne sensors to shed light on air turbulence, much like the seal-borne sensors used to measure salinity and sea temperature. \"People are already equipping animals with tags for lots of different reasons and in lots of different environments,\" says Shepard. \"They're effectively sampling in the environment all the time.\" Birds could act as meteorological sensors on the move, she says, continuously collecting data about the turbulence they're experiencing along their flight paths. This, she adds, would be cheaper than using sensors fitted to aircraft, plus birds can fly in conditions that planes can't. In another 2020 study, Shepard and her colleagues followed the flight of Andean condors, the world's heaviest soaring birds. They documented when and how individuals gained altitude, and recorded each and every wingbeat. The data revealed the lowest levels of flapping flight recorded for any free-ranging bird, with the condors spending an incredible 99% of all flight time in glide-mode \u2013 without flapping at all. One bird even remained airborne for more than five hours \u2013 covering over 170km (100 miles) \u2013 without a single flap. This research provides insight into the way soaring birds exploit thermals, knowledge which could potentially feed into the programming of autonomous flying vehicles.\u00a0 More like this: \u2022 Texas' skyscrapers are going dark to keep billions of birds safe \u2022 Inside the giant 'sky rivers' swelling with climate change \u2022 Stratoplanes: The aircraft that will fly at the edge of space Investigations into\u00a0how gulls soar above buildings could also help when it comes to planning flight paths for UAVs and drones in urban landscapes, says Shepard. In a similar way to birds, wind gusts and turbulence affect UAVs far more than larger aircraft, making flying at low altitudes in close proximity to terrain and buildings challenging. \"Urban environments are very turbulent. You've got all of these obstacles which disturb the flow. So, it's an ongoing challenge, thinking about how you can operate safely, particularly close to buildings where there's a risk that gusts could blow an aircraft towards a building and cause a crash.\" Urbanisation too, says Shepard, is contributing to more turbulent skies. \"We are modifying the substrate dramatically \u2013\u00a0and that is affecting the aerial environment above. Yet, we haven't really thought about urbanisation in terms of how it affects the costs and the abilities of animals to fly through that.\" \"There are still so many questions about turbulence,\" says Shepard \u2013 but one thing is for sure, our airborne travels across the globe are set to become rougher. Perhaps birds can teach us a thing or two about how to master the skies.\u00a0 \u2014 For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

Modern aircraft are equipped with sophisticated weather radar systems that pilots use to identify and navigate around areas of turbulence. \"We can successfully predict around 75% of turbulence up to 18 hours ahead,\" says Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading.\n\nModule 4:\nHowever, there are many types of turbulence \u2013 and some can be harder to spot. The severe turbulence that struck the Singapore Airlines flight is often caused by invisible \"clear air turbulence\". This can strike without warning, and is one of the biggest causes of weather-related aviation accidents. Clear air turbulence occurs at high altitudes, where aircraft cruise in seemingly calm blue skies. It can't be seen by the naked eye and is undetectable by onboard sensors. Even satellites can't see this kind of turbulence, only the structure and shape of the jet stream which may hint at its presence. Pilots often have to rely on any aircraft flying the same path ahead of them to report clear air turbulence, so they can adjust their path.\n\nModule 5:\nClimate change is making clear air turbulence more common, says Williams, who has studied the rise. \"In simple terms, climate change is increasing the temperature difference between the warm and cold air masses that collide to form the jet stream in the upper atmosphere,\" he says. \"This effect is making the jet stream less stable and allowing more turbulence to break out.\" Meteorologists are now seeking to develop better methods of forecasting all types of turbulence, using computer modelling. However, one source of data that's gone untapped until recently are the creatures we share the skies with: birds.\n\nModule 6:\nPrevious studies have shown that animal movements can help us determine the strength of thermal updrafts, wind direction and wind speed. Now researchers from Swansea University say birds' experience of the winds could help provide predictions of turbulence. Birds often migrate for thousands of miles \u2013 with wind speed, direction and turbulence all dictating the route they travel and the amount of energy they have to expend. And when you're running on reserves at the end of an epic trip half way around the world, catching the wrong winds can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nModule 7:\nWhile most species don't fly alongside cruising commercial jets, some get extremely high. Take frigate birds, for example. Their flight is a \"roller-coaster\", says Shepard. They rely on thermals and wind to stay aloft for months one end and can fly at extreme altitudes, as high as 13,000ft (4km/2.5 miles) above the ground. To reach this great height, they often catch strong updrafts in mountainous cumulus clouds. \"They gain altitude within these really, really turbulent cloud systems,\" says Shepard. \"You get monstrous updrafts and downdrafts. They are operating in incredibly turbulent environments \u2013 and we know so little about how they are able to maintain flight control.\"\n\nModule 8:\nBy studying how such birds respond to turbulence, Shepard and her colleagues at Swansea University's Laboratory for Animal Movement aim to \"visualise the invisible\", and to map what the air is doing. Sometimes that even involves flying alongside the birds. From 2018 to 2019, Shepard's team flew an ultralight aircraft alongside a flock of homing pigeons. Using GPS, barometric pressure and acceleration data loggers attached to the birds \u2013 over 88 flights \u2013 they measured the turbulence levels during the journeys the birds took to return to their lofts.\n\nModule 9:\nThe Swansea University research suggests the possibility of using bird-borne sensors to shed light on air turbulence, much like the seal-borne sensors used to measure salinity and sea temperature. \"People are already equipping animals with tags for lots of different reasons and in lots of different environments,\" says Shepard. \"They're effectively sampling in the environment all the time.\" Birds could act as meteorological sensors on the move, she says, continuously collecting data about the turbulence they're experiencing along their flight paths. This, she adds, would be cheaper than using sensors fitted to aircraft, plus birds can fly in conditions that planes can't.\n\nModule 10:\nIn another 2020 study, Shepard and her colleagues followed the flight of Andean condors, the world's heaviest soaring birds. They documented when and how individuals gained altitude, and recorded each and every wingbeat. The data revealed the lowest levels of flapping flight recorded for any free-ranging bird, with the condors spending an incredible 99% of all flight time in glide-mode \u2013 without flapping at all. One bird even remained airborne for more than five hours \u2013 covering over 170km (100 miles) \u2013 without a single flap. This research provides insight into the way soaring birds exploit thermals, knowledge which could potentially feed into the programming of autonomous flying vehicles.\n\nModule 11:\nInvestigations into how gulls soar above buildings could also help when it comes to planning flight paths for UAVs and drones in urban landscapes, says Shepard. In a similar way to birds, wind gusts and turbulence affect UAVs far more than larger aircraft, making flying at low altitudes in close proximity to terrain and buildings challenging. \"Urban environments are very turbulent. You've got all of these obstacles which disturb the flow. So, it's an ongoing challenge, thinking about how you can operate safely, particularly close to buildings where there's a risk that gusts could blow an aircraft towards a building and cause a crash.\"\n\nModule 12:\nUrbanisation too, says Shepard, is contributing to more turbulent skies. \"We are modifying the substrate dramatically \u2013 and that is affecting the aerial environment above. Yet, we haven't really thought about urbanisation in terms of how it affects the costs and the abilities of animals to fly through that.\" \"There are still so many questions about turbulence,\" says Shepard \u2013 but one thing is for sure, our airborne travels across the globe are set to become rougher. Perhaps birds can teach us a thing or two about how to master the skies.",

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nWhen you look up, the sky may seem calm \u2013 still even \u2013 but air is always on the move. Fluid, it flows like water, with eddies and currents, sometimes smooth and serene, sometimes tumultuous and violent. Turbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena. And research shows that severe turbulence is becoming more likely as the planet warms. If an aircraft strikes it, the most turbulent air can cause injuries or even death, as well as structural damage to planes. On Tuesday, a Singapore Airlines flight from London encountered severe turbulence: 31 people were injured, and one died. Passengers aboard the Boeing 777-300ER told the BBC the plane began to tilt and shake, before dropping suddenly, and \"people and objects were thrown around the cabin\".\n\nCould there be better ways to predict and cope with turbulence? Some researchers believe that answers lie in the animal world. Birds often encounter choppy skies. While only a few species reach the height of a cruising commercial aircraft, studying how they respond at lower altitudes could help meteorologists build better models to predict turbulence, says Emily Shepard, an expert in bird flight and air flow at Swansea University in Wales. And that's not all we could learn from our avian friends: some species have adapted to deal with \"extreme turbulence\", she says. Analysing how they exploit it to their advantage could inform aircraft design, especially in urban environments where smaller aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fly.\n\nAccording to a 2024 study, aircrafts encounter moderate to \"severe-or-greater\" turbulence 68,000 times every year. Turbulence is defined as \"an irregular motion of the air\" caused by eddies and vertical currents, and is associated with weather events such as fronts, wind shear and thunderstorms. Turbulence can cause a few uncomfortable bumps \u2013 or throw an aircraft out of control, inducing \"chaotic rolls, pitches and yaws\".

        "text": "Climate change is causing America's tornados to touch down in new locations, and occur at different times. Experts explain how best to prepare for these hard-to-predict disasters. Across the Great Plains of the US Midwest, we are fast approaching the peak tornado season of June and July. Already, tornadoes have caused devastating harm in the US, including in Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as in the state of Iowa and Michigan. As the National Severe Storms Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) notes, tornadoes can happen any time of the year. Due to climate change, tornado season is expected to change both in location and duration \u2013\u00a0adding another layer of complexity when it comes to preparing for the potentially violent phenomena. (Read more about how tornado alley is changing.) Around 1,200 tornadoes hit the US every year. They consist of narrow, rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground, gathering dust and debris beneath the swirling funnel. Tornado strength is measured by the damage they cause. Unlike the connection between climate change and other weather phenomena such as hurricanes, establishing a clear link between much more fleeting, smaller scale weather events like tornadoes is difficult \u2013 but not impossible. \"We expect that the number of days in any given year that are favourable for tornadoes\u2026 are going to increase in the future and specifically increase earlier in the season,\" Victor Gensini, associate professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University, tells the BBC. Greenfield, Iowa tornado A tornado struck the small town of Greenfield in Iowa on Tuesday 21 May 2024. The tornado killed several people, the state police said, devastating a \"good portion\" of the town. \"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said in a statement. Read the story on BBC News here. Across the US's southern Plains states like Oklahoma and Kansas, \"what might have been May and April as your peak months are now March, April, and May or even February\", Gensini says. He notes that there hasn't been an uptick in strong tornadoes \u2013 tornadoes at EF4 ratings and higher \u2013 over the last 50 years, but where they occur has been changing. States notorious for tornadoes such as Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas are actually seeing a decrease in tornadoes while states like Tennessee, Georgia and Arkansas as well as upper Midwest states like Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa are seeing an increase. \"We have way more people living in the mid-south and east of the Mississippi River than we do in the Great Plains,\" Gensini says. The higher population densities of the states seeing an increase in storms means that they have the potential to do more damage. As tornado seasons and locations change, one thing remains the same \u2013 the importance of preparation. \"It really starts with awareness,\" says David Titley, who was previously a rear admiral, oceanographer, and navigator of the US Navy. He also served as Noaa's chief operating officer before co-founding RV Weather Enterprises, which provides weather information and routing services to road travellers. How severe is a tornado? Tornados are measured using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which rates tornados based on estimated wind speeds based on the damage caused. The estimates for a gust lasting over three seconds correspond to EF ratings from zero to five: EF0: 65-85mph/105-137kph EF1: 86-110mph/138-177kph EF2: 111-135mph/178-217kph EF3: 136-165mph/219-266kph EF4: 166-200mph/267-322kph EF5: Over 200mph/322kph The scale builds on the Fujita Scale, which runs from F0 (gale) to F5 (incredible), which was replaced by the EF Scale in 2007. You can read more about the EF Scale on the National Weather Service website. For those looking to prepare, Titley notes that Noaa's National Weather Service issues severe weather\u00a0outlooks,\u00a0watches and warnings, all of which should be paid attention to through reliable devices. Local TV stations will put out screen crawlers or interrupt broadcasts entirely to cut to meteorologists when warnings are issued. Radio works as well, but only if you're familiar with the local geography because the information is typically broken down by county. Those who have moved away from television and radio in favour of digital services can get information from the\u00a0National Weather Service's account on X, formerly Twitter. At the other end of the spectrum, there's the very old-school\u00a0Noaa Weather Radio, which requires a special radio receiver or scanner capable of picking up 24-hour broadcasts of official warnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information from Noaa. \"Some people make fun of them,\" Titley says of the weather radios. \"It's probably 60-year-old technology, but it's kind of fool proof. It doesn't rely on the internet. It doesn't rely on cable. It doesn't rely on cell service.\" Titley has two portable versions, one for his RV and another for his truck. Trudy Thompson Shumaker, a volunteer and national spokesperson for the American Red Cross, says that education is key to preparing for tornadoes. \"Know what to do and how to stay safe,\" she says. This starts with identifying the safest room in your home \u2013 an interior, windowless space. Bathrooms sometimes meet these requirements, but a closet can also work as can an emergency stairwell in larger buildings. She also suggests assembling an emergency kit that contains the supplies necessary for sheltering in place for two weeks. \"You'll need water because the water supply may be unsafe. You'll need a battery-powered radio and phone chargers,\" says Thompson Shumaker. Before a tornado strikes, \"go through your phone and write down the important numbers you'll need if your phone goes dead\". She also suggests keeping a list of all necessary medications. In the event of a disaster, the Red Cross can help replace lost medications or medical devices at no cost to you. \"It won't be a three-month supply, but it will be enough to get you through the immediate time period,\" she says. Shoes, according to Thompson Shumaker, are another important consideration. She likes to go barefoot as often as possible while others around her Arizona home prefer flip flops, but keeping a sturdy pair of shoes nearby will come in handy during a disaster event that's littered the ground with debris like shattered glass, she says. Finally, Thompson Shumaker says that the American Red Cross's free Emergency App is another helpful tornado-preparation tool. By setting it to your zip code and those of your loved ones, you can be alerted to a range of hazards, from earthquakes and fires to tornadoes and hurricanes. Even without the app, you can call 1-800-RED-CROSS and, no matter where you are, \"they'll patch you through, connect you to volunteers closest to you, and we'll get you fixed up\", says Thompson Shumaker. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.

The estimates for a gust lasting over three seconds correspond to EF ratings from zero to five: EF0: 65-85mph/105-137kph EF1: 86-110mph/138-177kph EF2: 111-135mph/178-217kph EF3: 136-165mph/219-266kph EF4: 166-200mph/267-322kph EF5: Over 200mph/322kph\n\nFor those looking to prepare, Titley notes that Noaa's National Weather Service issues severe weather outlooks, watches and warnings, all of which should be paid attention to through reliable devices. Local TV stations will put out screen crawlers or interrupt broadcasts entirely to cut to meteorologists when warnings are issued. Radio works as well, but only if you're familiar with the local geography because the information is typically broken down by county. Those who have moved away from television and radio in favour of digital services can get information from the National Weather Service's account on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there's the very old-school Noaa Weather Radio, which requires a special radio receiver or scanner capable of picking up 24-hour broadcasts of official warnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information from Noaa. \"Some people make fun of them,\" Titley says of the weather radios. \"It's probably 60-year-old technology, but it's kind of fool proof. It doesn't rely on the internet. It doesn't rely on cable. It doesn't rely on cell service.\"\n\nTrudy Thompson Shumaker, a volunteer and national spokesperson for the American Red Cross, says that education is key to preparing for tornadoes. \"Know what to do and how to stay safe,\" she says. This starts with identifying the safest room in your home \u2013 an interior, windowless space. Bathrooms sometimes meet these requirements, but a closet can also work as can an emergency stairwell in larger buildings. She also suggests assembling an emergency kit that contains the supplies necessary for sheltering in place for two weeks. \"You'll need water because the water supply may be unsafe. You'll need a battery-powered radio and phone chargers,\" says Thompson Shumaker.\n\nBefore a tornado strikes, \"go through your phone and write down the important numbers you'll need if your phone goes dead\". She also suggests keeping a list of all necessary medications. In the event of a disaster, the Red Cross can help replace lost medications or medical devices at no cost to you. \"It won't be a three-month supply, but it will be enough to get you through the immediate time period,\" she says.\n\nShoes, according to Thompson Shumaker, are another important consideration. She likes to go barefoot as often as possible while others around her Arizona home prefer flip flops, but keeping a sturdy pair of shoes nearby will come in handy during a disaster event that's littered the ground with debris like shattered glass, she says.\n\nFinally, Thompson Shumaker says that the American Red Cross's free Emergency App is another helpful tornado-preparation tool. By setting it to your zip code and those of your loved ones, you can be alerted to a range of hazards, from earthquakes and fires to tornadoes and hurricanes. Even without the app, you can call 1-800-RED-CROSS and, no matter where you are, \"they'll patch you through, connect you to volunteers closest to you, and we'll get you fixed up\", says Thompson Shumaker."

        "title": "Inside the giant 'sky rivers' swelling with climate change",
        "text": "Atmospheric river storms have wreaked havoc on the West Coast, and are getting bigger. These scientists chase them in the sky to predict where they will strike. In January 2024, Anna Wilson was sitting aboard a Gulfstream IV jet, observing a deceptively calm-looking sea of white clouds over the northern Pacific Ocean. Through her headphones, Wilson \u2013 an atmospheric scientist and extreme weather expert \u2013 could hear her colleague give a countdown. At the back of the plane, another colleague dropped slim, cylindrical instruments through a chute, into the brewing storm below them, to measure its strength as it approached the US West Coast. The type of storm they were tracking is known as an atmospheric river \u2013 a weather phenomenon that has been attracting more and more attention in recent years, as scientists and the public race to understand its sometimes devastating impact. Research suggests that atmospheric rivers are getting bigger, more frequent and more extreme, due to climate change; and the damage they cause is getting worse. Often described as rivers in the sky, atmospheric rivers are a huge, invisible ribbons of water vapour. Each can be several hundreds of kilometres wide, and transport 27 times as much water as the Mississippi River. They are born in warm oceans, as seawater evaporates, rises and moves to cooler latitudes. When the vapour reaches a coast, such as California, it flows up a mountain, cools, and comes down as rain or snow \u2013 enough to wash down hillsides causing landslides, and bring torrential rain, floods and deadly avalanches. On the US West Coast, atmospheric rivers bring the heaviest rains, warmest storms, major floods, extreme coastal winds, and landslides. They can come in groups \u2013 known as \"families\" \u2013 with several of them striking a place within days. The brewing family of storms Wilson and her colleague were flying over was in fact formed by\u00a0four atmospheric rivers, which later caused heavy snowfall in California and floods in Oregon in January 2024. The basic questions remain the same for each atmospheric river, says Wilson, a field research manager at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"Where is it going to make landfall? How strong will it be? How long will it last? And we continue to get better at [answering] that,\" she says. The flight Wilson was on in January was part of Atmospheric River Reconnaissance, or AR Recon, a joint project with the US Air Force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and other partners. Using \"hurricane hunter\" aircraft normally deployed for observing hurricanes \u2013 the NOAA Gulfstream jet, as well as two or more Air Force aircraft \u2013 teams of scientists fly over atmospheric rivers, and drop instruments called dropsondes into them. \"Atmospheric rivers are interesting and cool but you can't see them, actually, because it's water vapour,\" Wilson says. \"And they're really close to the surface, they are usually focused on the lowest few kilometres of the atmosphere.\" Wilson points out that they tend to travel under cloud cover, which hides them from conventional weather observation tools like satellites. \"It's really hard for the satellites to sort of see through that, to what's going on at the near-surface. So the point of flying the aircraft through them is to be able to drop our sensors, and get these foundational meteorological measurements \u2013 temperature, air pressure, wind and moisture,\" she says. The atmospheric rivers Wilson and her team were monitoring in January were part of a series of\u00a051 atmospheric rivers\u00a0that hit Washington, Oregon and California between autumn 2023 and spring 2024, 13 more than the previous season. Knowing when and where such a storm will arrive, and how powerful it is, helps people on land prepare for what's coming, and for example, empty the right reservoirs in time. But Wilson and her colleagues' flights, which started in 2016, are also part of a wider scientific effort to better understand atmospheric rivers \u2013 including their surprising benefits. As extreme weather specialists are quick to point out, atmospheric rivers are not necessarily destructive. On the contrary, they can be life-sustaining. \"We need [atmospheric rivers] \u2013 without them in the West we have droughts,\" Wilson says. Up to two-thirds of the West Coast's droughts are brought to an end by the arrival of an atmospheric river \u2013 they are known as drought busters. \"There is a beneficial side of atmospheric rivers,\" agrees Bin Guan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"We tend to highlight the hazardous side but we have to remember that they provide important water supply in dry regions, such as California.\" Overall, they contribute up to 50% of California's rain and snow.  On the west coast of the US and Canada, atmospheric rivers have been known as the \"Pineapple Express\" due to their presumed origins near Hawaii. However,\u00a0Guan\u00a0says that name is rarely used amongst experts, since atmospheric rivers are a global phenomenon, and many of the ones hitting the West Coast in fact originate much further away than Hawaii. In October 2017, an unusually long atmospheric river extended roughly 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometres) from Japan to Washington. In 2019, researchers created a scale to rank atmospheric rivers from one (weak, producing modest rainfall) to five (exceptional, primarily hazardous) to give a more nuanced picture of them. \"The mild ones are considered beneficial for the water supply, only the very extreme ones are hazardous,\" says Qian Cao, a hydrologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"So it has both good sides and downsides, it doesn't only lead to bad events here.\" Predicting atmospheric rivers is key to limiting their destructive side, but is difficult, Cao says. For a start, they develop over the ocean, where there are fewer ways of observing them than on land. They then travel thousands of kilometres, and during that journey, can stall, intensify, weaken, get warmer or cooler, and interact with other atmospheric rivers, or remnants of them. Any of these changes will affect their impact, she says. Strategies such as forecast-informed reservoir operations, which use weather and water forecasting to help water managers decide whether to empty their reservoirs in expectation of massive rainfall, can help cope with them, she says. \"If we can forecast or predict these atmospheric rivers better, if we can predict them more accurately, with longer lead times, then we have more time to make operational decisions, for example, whether we want to release water or save water in the reservoirs,\" says Cao. Forecasts are most accurate in the short term, for lead times of three to five days, she says, and their accuracy decreases with longer lead times. \"Researchers are working very hard to improve forecasts beyond week two,\" she adds, since having a month or more to prepare would give people on the ground more options.  This is where the AR Recon flights come in, looking inside the sky rivers, where other instruments can't reach. For Wilson's team, each flight begins with a forecast meeting in the morning, discussing existing forecasts of rain and snow in the US in the coming days. They identify areas of uncertainty that could be improved through more data on the atmospheric river that is bringing the expected rain or snow. They then fly to that atmospheric river, and collect the required data with the dropsondes. \"The purpose of these targeted reconnaissance flights is to fill gaps, when we know the satellites have a difficult time seeing,\" Wilson says. Each Gulfstream flight lasts around eight hours \u2013 and as Wilson says, one vital bit of practical preparation is to bring your own food. The instruments transmit the data to the team aboard the aircraft, who check it and transmit it to the Global Telecommunications System,\u00a0a World Meteorological Organization service that collects and distributes global weather-related data. It is then picked up by forecasting models, which use the data together with hundreds of millions of other observations, including from satellites. The now more accurate forecasts, enhanced by the dropsonde data, are shared with reservoir operators and emergency responders. Studies suggest that the dropsonde data indeed helps improve forecasts, with a recent analysis recommending that future missions involve daily flights and both the Gulfstream jet and Air Force aircraft, to gather as much data as possible. The team are also using other technologies to collect information, as well as working on modelling systems, to further improve forecasts and deepen their understanding of individual storms. This race to understand atmospheric rivers is especially urgent, researchers say, as studies suggest they are changing, and becoming more frequent \u2013 and potentially, becoming more devastating.  Mengqian Lu is an associate professor in hydrometeorology and water resources\u00a0at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. She and her team published a global study in January 2024 projecting their future intensity, frequency and associated rainfall and snowfall around the world. According to their projections, the global frequency of atmospheric rivers could almost double by the end of this century. But what exactly that means on the ground varies from region to region, the study suggests. \"In general, the more frequent and stronger [the atmospheric river], the more frequent and stronger rainfall it brings \u2013 but the translation is not one-to-one because the climate system is non-linear, rather chaotic,\" Lu says. What seems likely is that as the atmosphere warms with climate change, it will be able to hold increasing levels of moisture. \"As a result we expect to see more frequent and stronger atmospheric rivers,\" she says. Because of their role in transporting heat as well as moisture, knowing how atmospheric rivers will change as climate continues to warm up is essential for understanding the broader impact of global warming, Lu says. For instance, atmospheric rivers bringing warmth have triggered the melting of ice shelves in West Antarctica. A growing body of research highlights their impact around the world. In East Asia, they contribute up to 90% of extreme rainfall in the warm seasons, and have caused floods and landslides. They can affect multiple locations, with several places experiencing disastrous weather at the same time, or in close succession, as atmospheric rivers might bring snow and blizzards to one region, and rain and severe floods to another. They can also form vicious cycles with other disasters, such as wildfires, causing mudslides in areas scarred by fire where the lack of vegetation makes the soil less absorbant and vulnerable to erosion. They can also drive fast plant growth that turns into fuel for the next fire, leading to an increase in the burned areas the following season, research suggests. Back-to-back atmospheric rivers \u2013 one after the other, bringing seemingly endless rain \u2013 are also becoming more common, studies suggest. From late December 2022 to mid-January 2023, nine atmospheric rivers hit California in a row, resulting in floods, landslides and power outages. As the authors of one study point out, such clusters can mean the drenched soil cannot dry out in between the storms, making flooding more likely. (Read more about how climate change could bring megafloods to California.) \"In the western US, atmospheric rivers account for nearly 90% of the flood damages, totalling more than $1bn (\u00a380m) a year. This number could double or even triple by the end of this century based on climate model projections of changes in atmospheric rivers,\" Guan says. Nor do they always carry water vapour alone. In 2021, they drove Saharan dust from Africa to Europe, darkening the snow in the Alps, reducing its reflectiveness, bringing heat, and reducing snow depth by 50%. More like this: Given this global scale and complexity, how can we cope with atmospheric rivers? Cao says we need to recognise how climate change is altering them, and adopt more sustainable development measures to fight global warming. Early warning systems, public awareness and more accurate and sophisticated forecasts are also crucial in helping us be prepared, she says \u2013 as well as understanding which weather patterns and climate conditions help generate atmospheric rivers in the first place. Meanwhile, it may be at least some comfort to know that hundreds of dropsondes are falling through these mysterious storms each year, collecting data that makes them more predictable. Wilson says the mission gives her hope, especially the work with responders on land, such as the emergency operations centre in California: \"It's a really awesome feeling as a scientist to work on something that is so immediately applicable. This is making an impact right now for people on the ground,\" she says. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.

        "Modularized": "Here is the modularized article:\n\nModule 1:\nIn January 2024, Anna Wilson was sitting aboard a Gulfstream IV jet, observing a deceptively calm-looking sea of white clouds over the northern Pacific Ocean. Through her headphones, Wilson \u2013 an atmospheric scientist and extreme weather expert \u2013 could hear her colleague give a countdown. At the back of the plane, another colleague dropped slim, cylindrical instruments through a chute, into the brewing storm below them, to measure its strength as it approached the US West Coast.\n\nModule 2:\nThe type of storm they were tracking is known as an atmospheric river \u2013 a weather phenomenon that has been attracting more and more attention in recent years, as scientists and the public race to understand its sometimes devastating impact. Research suggests that atmospheric rivers are getting bigger, more frequent and more extreme, due to climate change; and the damage they cause is getting worse.\n\nModule 3:\nOften described as rivers in the sky, atmospheric rivers are a huge, invisible ribbons of water vapour. Each can be several hundreds of kilometres wide, and transport 27 times as much water as the Mississippi River. They are born in warm oceans, as seawater evaporates, rises and moves to cooler latitudes. When the vapour reaches a coast, such as California, it flows up a mountain, cools, and comes down as rain or snow \u2013 enough to wash down hillsides causing landslides, and bring torrential rain, floods and deadly avalanches.\n\nModule 4:\nOn the US West Coast, atmospheric rivers bring the heaviest rains, warmest storms, major floods, extreme coastal winds, and landslides. They can come in groups \u2013 known as \"families\" \u2013 with several of them striking a place within days. The brewing family of storms Wilson and her colleague were flying over was in fact formed by four atmospheric rivers, which later caused heavy snowfall in California and floods in Oregon in January 2024.\n\nModule 5:\nThe basic questions remain the same for each atmospheric river, says Wilson, a field research manager at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"Where is it going to make landfall? How strong will it be? How long will it last? And we continue to get better at [answering] that,\" she says.\n\nModule 6:\nThe flight Wilson was on in January was part of Atmospheric River Reconnaissance, or AR Recon, a joint project with the US Air Force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and other partners. Using \"hurricane hunter\" aircraft normally deployed for observing hurricanes \u2013 the NOAA Gulfstream jet, as well as two or more Air Force aircraft \u2013 teams of scientists fly over atmospheric rivers, and drop instruments called dropsondes into them.\n\nModule 7:\n\"Atmospheric rivers are interesting and cool but you can't see them, actually, because it's water vapour,\" Wilson says. \"And they're really close to the surface, they are usually focused on the lowest few kilometres of the atmosphere.\" Wilson points out that they tend to travel under cloud cover, which hides them from conventional weather observation tools like satellites.\n\nModule 8:\n\"It's really hard for the satellites to sort of see through that, to what's going on at the near-surface. So the point of flying the aircraft through them is to be able to drop our sensors, and get these foundational meteorological measurements \u2013 temperature, air pressure, wind and moisture,\" she says.\n\nModule 9:\nThe atmospheric rivers Wilson and her team were monitoring in January were part of a series of 51 atmospheric rivers that hit Washington, Oregon and California between autumn 2023 and spring 2024, 13 more than the previous season. Knowing when and where such a storm will arrive, and how powerful it is, helps people on land prepare for what's coming, and for example, empty the right reservoirs in time.\n\nModule 10:\nBut Wilson and her colleagues' flights, which started in 2016, are also part of a wider scientific effort to better understand atmospheric rivers \u2013 including their surprising benefits. As extreme weather specialists are quick to point out, atmospheric rivers are not necessarily destructive. On the contrary, they can be life-sustaining.\n\nModule 11:\n\"We need [atmospheric rivers] \u2013 without them in the West we have droughts,\" Wilson says. Up to two-thirds of the West Coast's droughts are brought to an end by the arrival of an atmospheric river \u2013 they are known as drought busters. \"There is a beneficial side of atmospheric rivers,\" agrees Bin Guan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nModule 12:\n\"They provide important water supply in dry regions, such as California.\" Overall, they contribute up to 50% of California's rain and snow. On the west coast of the US and Canada, atmospheric rivers have been known as the \"Pineapple Express\" due to their presumed origins near Hawaii. However, Guan says that name is rarely used amongst experts, since atmospheric rivers are a global phenomenon, and many of the ones hitting the West Coast in fact originate much further away than Hawaii.\n\nModule 13:\nIn October 2017, an unusually long atmospheric river extended roughly 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometres) from Japan to Washington. In 2019, researchers created a scale to rank atmospheric rivers from one (weak, producing modest rainfall) to five (exceptional, primarily hazardous) to give a more nuanced picture of them.\n\nModule 14:\n\"The mild ones are considered beneficial for the water supply, only the very extreme ones are hazardous,\" says Qian Cao, a hydrologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"So it has both good sides and downsides, it doesn't only lead to bad events here.\"\n\nModule 15:\nPredicting atmospheric rivers is key to limiting their destructive side, but is difficult, Cao says. For a start, they develop over the ocean, where there are fewer ways of observing them than on land. They then travel thousands of kilometres, and during that journey, can stall, intensify, weaken, get warmer or cooler, and interact with other atmospheric rivers, or remnants of them.\n\nModule 16:\nAny of these changes will affect their impact, she says. Strategies such as forecast-informed reservoir operations, which use weather and water forecasting to help water managers decide whether to empty their reservoirs in expectation of massive rainfall, can help cope with them, she says.\n\nModule 17:\n\"If we can forecast or predict these atmospheric rivers better, if we can predict them more accurately, with longer lead times, then we have more time to make operational decisions, for example, whether we want to release water or save water in the reservoirs,\" says Cao.\n\nModule 18:\nForecasts are most accurate in the short term, for lead times of three to five days, she says, and their accuracy decreases with longer lead times. \"Researchers are working very hard to improve forecasts beyond week two,\" she adds, since having a month or more to prepare would give people on the ground more options.\n\nModule 19:\nThis is where the AR Recon flights come in, looking inside the sky rivers, where other instruments can't reach. For Wilson's team, each flight begins with a forecast meeting in the morning, discussing existing forecasts of rain and snow in the US in the coming days. They identify areas of uncertainty that could be improved through more data on the atmospheric river that is bringing the expected rain or snow.\n\nModule 20:\nThey then fly to that atmospheric river, and collect the required data with the dropsondes. \"The purpose of these targeted reconnaissance flights is to fill gaps, when we know the satellites have a difficult time seeing,\" Wilson says.\n\nModule 21:\nEach Gulfstream flight lasts around eight hours \u2013 and as Wilson says, one vital bit of practical preparation is to bring your own food. The instruments transmit the data to the team aboard the aircraft, who check it and transmit it to the Global Telecommunications System, a World Meteorological Organization service that collects and distributes global weather-related data.\n\nModule 22:\nIt is then picked up by forecasting models, which use the data together with hundreds of millions of other observations, including from satellites. The now more accurate forecasts, enhanced by the dropsonde data, are shared with reservoir operators and emergency responders.\n\nModule 23:\nStudies suggest that the dropsonde data indeed helps improve forecasts, with a recent analysis recommending that future missions involve daily flights and both the Gulfstream jet and Air Force aircraft, to gather as much data as possible.\n\nModule 24:\nThe team are also using other technologies to collect information, as well as working on modelling systems, to further improve forecasts and deepen their understanding of individual storms. This race to understand atmospheric rivers is especially urgent, researchers say, as studies suggest they are changing, and becoming more frequent \u2013 and potentially, becoming more devastating.\n\nModule 25:\nMengqian Lu is an associate professor in hydrometeorology and water resources at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. She and her team published a global study in January 2024 projecting their future intensity, frequency and associated rainfall and snowfall around the world.\n\nModule 26:\nAccording to their projections, the global frequency of atmospheric rivers could almost double by the end of this century.

        "title": "Climate change: World's oceans suffer from record-breaking year of heat",
        "text": "Fuelled by climate change, the world's oceans have broken temperature records every single day over the past year, a BBC analysis finds.  Nearly 50 days have smashed existing highs for the time of year by the largest margin in the satellite era. Planet-warming gases are mostly to blame, but the natural weather event El Ni\u00f1o has also helped warm the seas. The super-heated oceans have hit marine life hard and driven a new wave of coral bleaching. The analysis is based on data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Service. Copernicus also confirmed that last month was the warmest April on record in terms of global air temperatures, extending that sequence of month-specific records to 11 in a row. For many decades, the world's oceans have been the Earth's 'get-out-of-jail card' when it comes to climate change.  Not only do they absorb around a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans produce, they also soak up around 90% of the excess heat.  But over the past year, the oceans have displayed the most concerning evidence yet that they are struggling to cope, with the sea surface particularly feeling the heat. From March 2023, the average surface temperature of the global oceans started to shoot further and further above the long-term norm, hitting a new record high in August.  Recent months have brought no respite, with the sea surface reaching a new global average daily high of 21.09C in February and March this year, according to Copernicus data.  As the graph below shows, not only has every single day since 4 May 2023 broken the daily record for the time of year, but on some days the margin has been huge. Around 47 days smashed the record for that day of the year by at least 0.3C, according to BBC analysis of Copernicus data.  Never before in the satellite era had the margin of record been this big.  The biggest record-breaking days were 23 August 2023, 3 January 2024 and 5 January 2024, when the previous high was beaten by around 0.34C.  \"The fact that all this heat is going into the ocean, and in fact, it's warming in some respects even more rapidly than we thought it would, is a cause for great concern,\" says Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey.  \"These are real signs of the environment moving into areas where we really don't want it to be and if it carries on in that direction the consequences will be severe.\" This human-driven ocean warming is having considerable impacts on global sea life and may even be shifting the seasonal cycle of sea temperatures, according to a recent study. Perhaps the most significant consequence of the recent warmth has been the mass bleaching of coral globally. These key ocean nurseries turn white and die because the waters they live in grow too hot. They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species. Unusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin. \"There have been examples of the sea-ice collapsing before emperor chicks have properly fledged, and there have been mass drowning events,\" says Prof Meredith.  \"The emperor penguin is a threatened species because of climate change, and the sea-ice and the ocean temperatures are strongly implicated in that.\" In the UK, rising sea temperatures are having an impact, with a number of creatures having vanished completely from coastal locations - some barnacle species, for example. \"The problem of climate change is that it's happening too quickly for evolution to catch up with it,\" says marine biologist Dr Nova Mieszkowska from the University of Liverpool.

Collecting DNA traces from water samples, they show some invasive species are thriving, including a sea squirt that is believed to have originated in Japan and which grows like a carpet over the sea floor. \"They prevent the growth of native organisms in the areas that they colonise,\" says Prof Iain Barber, head of Life Sciences at Aberystwyth University.  \"Because they do so well in our environment, they can potentially take over huge areas of the seabed.\" Species that are more invasive appear to be responding more strongly to global warming and the increasing water temperatures, Prof Barber says.   One important factor that's made the last year more impactful in seas all over the world has been the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, adding to human-driven emissions of warming gases.  El Ni\u00f1o sees warmer waters come to the surface of the Pacific. As a result, it tends to push up the global average. El Ni\u00f1o kicked into gear in June 2023 - after a prolonged period of cooler La Ni\u00f1a conditions - and reached a peak in December, although it has since been fading away.  But other ocean basins that aren't usually affected by El Ni\u00f1o have also experienced record marine heatwaves - leaving scientists trying to work out exactly what is going on. \"The Atlantic has been warmer than usual, and this is not a pattern you normally associate with El Ni\u00f1o - so it's something somehow different,\" explains Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus.  This heat is still persisting in many ocean basins, including the tropical Atlantic.  Warmer seas give tropical storms extra energy, and this could help to fuel a potentially damaging hurricane season. \"There is still a large patch of warmer than usual water in the tropical Atlantic [and] this is the main development region for tropical cyclones,\" explains Dr Buontempo. \"We are almost a month ahead in the sea surface temperature in the Atlantic with respect to the annual cycle [...] so this is an area that has to be watched.\" As well as these short-term impacts, researchers warn there will be long-term consequences that society will have to adapt to.  For example, ice-sheet melting and deep-ocean warming are likely to continue to fuel sea-level rise in the centuries to come. \"When we talk about climate change, we tend to reduce that to changes on the surface because we live there,\" said Ang\u00e9lique Melet, a researcher with Mercator Ocean International.  \"However, the deep ocean is one of the aspects [of global warming] that is committing us to centuries and millennia of [climate] change.\" But Dr Melet stresses that is not a reason to give up on cutting emissions. \"Depending on our actions, we can reduce the speed of that warming, and we can decrease the overall amplitude of that warming and sea-level rise.\" Graphics by Erwan Rivault, Muskeen Liddar and Mark Poynting A new exhibition will examine how JMW Turner captured the impact people were having on the environment. Our skies are getting bumpier, making the need to understand and predict turbulence increasingly urgent. Researchers propose birds could provide clues. Butterflies act as an early warning indicator of changes in the environment, scientists say. The number of hurricanes is not increasing, but they are becoming more intense as the world warms. There could be up to seven major hurricanes of category three or higher this season, many more than usual. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Inside the box, every burp, belch and gaseous emission can be measured. Cows\u2019 burps are rich in methane, a greenhouse gas, and only by recording them in this way can we start to unravel how to mitigate the damage livestock farming can do to the climate. The cattle industry contributes 40% of all methane emissions from food production. They\u2019re not the biggest contributors, that title goes to rice, but researchers are keen to clean up their act. It is part of a new wave of farming methods and high-tech solutions aimed at turning farming from being a climate change problem to a part of the solution.\u00a0 Agriculture as a whole, and the deforestation that sometimes accompanies it, contributes nearly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Farming also accounts for 70% of water usage worldwide. This is not only changing the climate, but also affecting our ability to grow food in the first place. Drought, flooding, high temperatures and rising sea levels are turning productive parts of our planet into places that are incapable of growing food.\u00a0 But what if we could produce food in a way that not only reduces the impact farming has on the planet, but could even be beneficial for the climate. Cattle are ruminants, meaning part of their digestive system (the rumen) is designed to ferment low-nutrition foods like grasses and leaves. It contains an assortment of microbes that help them extract as many nutrients as they can from their food. Unfortunately, some of these microbes produce methane that is then released from the rumen. And it is here that Nielsen has turned her focus. \"It\u2019s not the cow that produces the methane, it\u2019s these microorganisms called Archaea,\" she says. \"So if we could just block this process and persuade the Archaea not to produce the methane we would basically have a climate neutral cow.\u201d While some might argue that giving up cattle farming altogether might be the best way to mitigate climate change, as Nielsen explains to James Wong in the video below, for many people giving up beef is not a reasonable solution. Your browser does not support HTML5 video. 00:00 / 00:00 advertisement advertisement Nielsen and other researchers are instead interested in the methane-inhibiting properties of an unlikely source: seaweed. Asparagopsis, a warm-water seaweed species grown in Australia, contains a compound called bromoform that when used to comprise as little as 2% of a cow\u2019s diet, reduces the animal\u2019s methane emissions by up to 98%. There are, however, questions over whether cows like the taste of bromoform \u2013 in some experiments livestock reduced the amount they ate after the seaweed was introduced to their diet. Bromoform can be carcinogenic in humans, although there is little research to show whether this is transferred into any meat and diary products. Many people are also already exposed to low levels of bromoform through tap water. On the south-west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, scientists and farmers at Cascadia Seaweed are working to grow their seaweed farms to be the largest in North America. Not technically a plant, the macroalgae is one of the few vegan sources of the vitamin B12 and only requires the sea and sunlight to grow.\u00a0 The cultivation process begins by harvesting reproductive patches, called sori, from blades of seaweed and bringing them to a nursery. Once there, spores are released and attach to spools of twine. After 45 days, the seedlings are developed enough to be deployed at sea where they are attached to cultivation lines and grow into kelp. \u201cWe only use local species, we don't do anything invasive, and we collect our sori in the same areas where we plant seaweed,\u201d says Cascadia Seaweed's chief executive Mike Williamson.\u00a0 Not only does seaweed farming emit few greenhouse gases, seaweed is 20 times more effective at sequestering carbon than land plants, according to a 2019 study by Harvard University. \u201cWhen seaweed grows, a certain amount of it sloughs off into the deep ocean and stays in the sediment forever,\u201d says Williamson. \u201cThat's permanent carbon sequestration.\u201d At the same time as it stores carbon, seaweed also absorbs excess nutrients from fertilisers that get washed into rivers and the oceans. While fertilisers have helped to boost crops yields on land, excess amounts washed into waterways can alter habitats and damage marine life. At the same time, synthetic fertilisers release potent greenhouse gases into the atmosphere during their manufacture and once they are on the fields. One solution is to use farming techniques that use these chemicals more carefully. New technology is enabling large scale farmers to reduce their use of water, fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides while at the same time boosting their profits. Precision agriculture, as it is known, aims to target the right amount of water and chemical treatments to only where they are needed, avoiding widespread spraying and wastage.\u00a0 One such development is the use of silica nanoparticles that release fertiliser and pesticides at a slow, steady rate, reducing the amount and frequency with which they\u2019re used. Some of these solutions also contain microorganisms to help jumpstart soil regeneration. Alternatively, Blue River Technology hope to reduce chemical usage with their See and Spray technology, and have partnered with agricultural machinery manufacturer John Deere to bring it to life. By using artificial intelligence to selectively target weeds with herbicide, they\u2019re able to avoid indiscriminate spraying that blankets an entire crop and its surrounding soil with chemicals. Blue River Technology say they spray between 10% and 30% of the volume of chemicals normally used in traditional farming methods. Cameras attached to a self-propelled sprayer connect to computer processors that use a machine learning algorithm to recognise the captured image in milliseconds. Based on this information, the machine determines whether to spray the herbicide or not. The AI is trained for a couple of seasons so it can recognise the weed and tell it apart from the crop. So far it has been used in fields of corn, cotton and soy.\u00a0 If successful, See and Spray could potentially be a significant cost-saving measure for farmers given that in 2019, almost $33bn (\u00a325bn) was spent across the globe on herbicides and that number is increasing. At the same time, it helps to mitigate the effect of surplus chemicals on the environment. But a new wave of farmers are hoping to cut out their use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides altogether by allowing the natural microorganisms that live in the soil to flourish instead. \"Regenerative agriculture in its basic form is not disturbing the soil\u2026 it's leaving that life in the soil where it is and just feeding it,\" says Tom Morphew, chief executive at Full Circle Farms in Sussex, UK. While industrial farming has brought about dramatic increases in crop yields and made it possible to feed a rapidly growing population, some practices can degrade the soil. Much of this disruption comes from the use of chemical fertilisers, herbicides, and insecticides, which can affect the natural balance of fungi, bacteria and other organisms living in the soil, says Morphew. \"We\u2019ve broken that system of life in the soil. There's nothing holding our soil together.\"\u00a0 This has another unfortunate side-effect \u2013 soils can start to release carbon into the atmosphere. Harmful agricultural techniques have \"shifted the global cropping soil from a carbon sink to a carbon source, contributing to the global climate crisis\", says Yichao Rui, a soil scientist at the Rodale Institute, a non-profit based in Pennsylvania, US, that supports research into organic farming. Now \"we need to maximise the carbon inputs and minimise the carbon outputs\", says Rui.\u00a0 Maximising the amount of carbon that can be stored in the soil requires keeping fields covered with living plants all year long to encourage deep root growth, which helps to transfer the carbon gathered from the atmosphere by the plant to the dirt. Soil-dwelling fungi feed on the carbon delivered by the roots and provide the plants with other nutrients in return. Applying microbe-rich compost to topsoil also helps. \"Soil microbes play a very important role in decomposing these carbon inputs from plants and converting them into the form that can be sequestered,\" says Rui.\u00a0 Regenerative farmers like those at Full Circle Farms avoid excessive tilling to help maintain the soil structure and the fungal communities living in it. This, together with other practices such as using cover crops and companion planting, are aimed at helping turn the soil back into a carbon store again. There are some doubts, however, about how much of an impact these approaches can have in terms of pulling carbon back into the soil particularly over the long term.\u00a0 But it may be possible to increase the amount of carbon that can be stored in the soil. With the help of precision gene-editing techniques, some researchers are developing new varieties of crops capable of sucking up more carbon from the atmosphere. Watch the video below to find out more about how this can help to fix more carbon into the soil. Your browser does not support HTML5 video. 00:00 / 00:00 advertisement advertisement It would be difficult to eliminate agriculture\u2019s environmental impact entirely, even in light of these advancements. Some scientists believe the answer might involve taking farming indoors or underground, where leafy vegetables grow without soil or sunlight. Indoor farming not only eliminates arable land use, but requires no pesticides and significantly reduces water usage.\u00a0 Crops grown in this way are watered using aeroponics, where plants grow roots through cloth, or hydroponics, which uses water in place of soil. While innovative, it isn\u2019t yet feasible to apply these techniques to staple crops that require a lot of space, like cereals, and the approach is relatively energy intensive.\u00a0 An alternative may be seawater greenhouses, which use only seawater and sunlight to grow food, even in inhospitable desert environments.\u00a0 Using seawater instead of freshwater relieves some of the environmental stresses of growing veg in this energy intensive way.\u00a0 If seawater can be used to grow vegetables, could we create edible commodities out of other unlikely sources?\u00a0 Outside of Toronto, Canada, Entomo Farms has a vision to use cricket protein as a global food security and environmental solution. Crickets contain as much protein per 100g as beef along with a variety of other key nutrients, according to a report on edible insects by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and up to three times as much B12. \"Research shows that not only are those concentrations far higher, but they are more absorbable,\" says Entomo Farms co-founder Jarrod Goldin.\u00a0 And unlike beef and pork, insects like crickets emit comparatively low greenhouse gases and require very little feed, land, or water, according to the FAO. Another approach is seeking to use greenhouse gases themselves in our food. Carbon capture technologies make use of CO2 captured from a concentrated source, such as a cement plant, or direct air capture which removes carbon dioxide from ambient air. The captured CO2 can be stored permanently in the Earth. But when carbon capture technology isn\u2019t used to sequester carbon, the CO2 can be repurposed to create products like vodka and sparkling water. Coca-Cola has partnered with Climeworks, a Swiss direct air capture company, to use captured CO2 to give the sparkling water Valser its fizz. Once the bottle is opened the CO2 is released back into the air, but the alternative to using captured CO2 in drinks is to take natural gas safely stored underground or use byproducts from manufacturing. Air Company, a New York-based startup, recently launched Air Vodka, the first spirit in the world to use ethanol made from captured CO2. The CO2 is collected and combined with renewable hydrogen produced by water electrolysis to create the alcohol.\u00a0 While vodka may not solve global food security issues, these consumer products are helping to create demand for carbon capture technology, which if scaled up could play a role in reducing CO2 emissions. This could be the thin end of the wedge for new, green foods.\u00a0 There is no silver-bullet approach to making agriculture more sustainable, but those at the vanguard of change are proving there are solutions. The combination of technological innovation, new ways of farming and changing consumer demand will create a meaningful shift in the world\u2019s food footprint. The tools, technology and practices that could completely transform food production from an environmental burden to a green solution are coming. Whether we use them is up to us. This article is part of a multimedia series Follow the Food by BBC Future and BBC World News. Now in its second series, Follow the Food investigates how agriculture is responding to the profound challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, rapidly growing populations and the Covid-19 pandemic, which has brought new challenges to our global food supply chains. Follow the Food traces emerging answers to these problems \u2013 both high-tech and low-tech, local and global \u2013 from farmers, growers and researchers across six continents. in associationwith Copyright \u00a9 2021 BBC.

Not technically a plant, the macroalgae is one of the few vegan sources of the vitamin B12 and only requires the sea and sunlight to grow.\n\nModule 6:\nNot only does seaweed farming emit few greenhouse gases, seaweed is 20 times more effective at sequestering carbon than land plants, according to a 2019 study by Harvard University. \u201cWhen seaweed grows, a certain amount of it sloughs off into the deep ocean and stays in the sediment forever,\u201d says Williamson. \u201cThat's permanent carbon sequestration.\u201d At the same time as it stores carbon, seaweed also absorbs excess nutrients from fertilisers that get washed into rivers and the oceans.\n\nModule 7:\nOne solution is to use farming techniques that use these chemicals more carefully. New technology is enabling large scale farmers to reduce their use of water, fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides while at the same time boosting their profits. Precision agriculture, as it is known, aims to target the right amount of water and chemical treatments to only where they are needed, avoiding widespread spraying and wastage.\n\nModule 8:\nAlternatively, Blue River Technology hope to reduce chemical usage with their See and Spray technology, and have partnered with agricultural machinery manufacturer John Deere to bring it to life. By using artificial intelligence to selectively target weeds with herbicide, they\u2019re able to avoid indiscriminate spraying that blankets an entire crop and its surrounding soil with chemicals.\n\nModule 9:\nBut a new wave of farmers are hoping to cut out their use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides altogether by allowing the natural microorganisms that live in the soil to flourish instead. \"Regenerative agriculture in its basic form is not disturbing the soil\u2026 it's leaving that life in the soil where it is and just feeding it,\" says Tom Morphew, chief executive at Full Circle Farms in Sussex, UK.\n\nModule 10:\nWhile industrial farming has brought about dramatic increases in crop yields and made it possible to feed a rapidly growing population, some practices can degrade the soil. Much of this disruption comes from the use of chemical fertilisers, herbicides, and insecticides, which can affect the natural balance of fungi, bacteria and other organisms living in the soil, says Morphew. \"We\u2019ve broken that system of life in the soil. There's nothing holding our soil together.\"\n\nModule 11:\nThis has another unfortunate side-effect \u2013 soils can start to release carbon into the atmosphere. Harmful agricultural techniques have \"shifted the global cropping soil from a carbon sink to a carbon source, contributing to the global climate crisis\", says Yichao Rui, a soil scientist at the Rodale Institute, a non-profit based in Pennsylvania, US, that supports research into organic farming.\n\nModule 12:\nMaximising the amount of carbon that can be stored in the soil requires keeping fields covered with living plants all year long to encourage deep root growth, which helps to transfer the carbon gathered from the atmosphere by the plant to the dirt. Soil-dwelling fungi feed on the carbon delivered by the roots and provide the plants with other nutrients in return. Applying microbe-rich compost to topsoil also helps.\n\nModule 13:\nRegenerative farmers like those at Full Circle Farms avoid excessive tilling to help maintain the soil structure and the fungal communities living in it.

Indoor farming not only eliminates arable land use, but requires no pesticides and significantly reduces water usage.\n\nModule 15:\nCrops grown in this way are watered using aeroponics, where plants grow roots through cloth, or hydroponics, which uses water in place of soil. While innovative, it isn\u2019t yet feasible to apply these techniques to staple crops that require a lot of space, like cereals, and the approach is relatively energy intensive.\n\nModule 16:\nAn alternative may be seawater greenhouses, which use only seawater and sunlight to grow food, even in inhospitable desert environments. Using seawater instead of freshwater relieves some of the environmental stresses of growing veg in this energy intensive way.\n\nModule 17:\nIf seawater can be used to grow vegetables, could we create edible commodities out of other unlikely sources? Outside of Toronto, Canada, Entomo Farms has a vision to use cricket protein as a global food security and environmental solution.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nOverseeing the cow\u2019s welfare is Mette Nielsen, a professor in animal sciences at Aarhus University, who explains the purpose of Daisy\u2019s confinement. Inside the box, every burp, belch and gaseous emission can be measured. Cows\u2019 burps are rich in methane, a greenhouse gas, and only by recording them in this way can we start to unravel how to mitigate the damage livestock farming can do to the climate. The cattle industry contributes 40% of all methane emissions from food production. They\u2019re not the biggest contributors, that title goes to rice, but researchers are keen to clean up their act. It is part of a new wave of farming methods and high-tech solutions aimed at turning farming from being a climate change problem to a part of the solution. \n\nAgriculture as a whole, and the deforestation that sometimes accompanies it, contributes nearly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Farming also accounts for 70% of water usage worldwide. This is not only changing the climate, but also affecting our ability to grow food in the first place. Drought, flooding, high temperatures and rising sea levels are turning productive parts of our planet into places that are incapable of growing food. \n\nBut what if we could produce food in a way that not only reduces the impact farming has on the planet, but could even be beneficial for the climate. Cattle are ruminants, meaning part of their digestive system (the rumen) is designed to ferment low-nutrition foods like grasses and leaves. It contains an assortment of microbes that help them extract as many nutrients as they can from their food. Unfortunately, some of these microbes produce methane that is then released from the rumen. And it is here that Nielsen has turned her focus. \"It\u2019s not the cow that produces the methane, it\u2019s these microorganisms called Archaea,\" she says. \"So if we could just block this process and persuade the Archaea not to produce the methane we would basically have a climate neutral cow.\u201d\n\nWhile some might argue that giving up cattle farming altogether might be the best way to mitigate climate change, as Nielsen explains, for many people giving up beef is not a reasonable solution. Nielsen and other researchers are instead interested in the methane-inhibiting properties of an unlikely source: seaweed. Asparagopsis, a warm-water seaweed species grown in Australia, contains a compound called bromoform that when used to comprise as little as 2% of a cow\u2019s diet, reduces the animal\u2019s methane emissions by up to 98%. \n\nOn the south-west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, scientists and farmers at Cascadia Seaweed are working to grow their seaweed farms to be the largest in North America.

As witnesses to a changing climate over millennia, the Antarctic ice sheets are a unique record for studying past climate change informing predictions about the future \u2013 but deciphering the climate history of a continent to make predictions about the whole planet requires multinational collaboration. The Antarctic ice sheet covers 8.3% of the Earth\u2019s surface and is the largest store of frozen fresh water on the planet. If all the ice melted to liquid water, it would raise global sea levels by 57.9m (190ft) \u2013 this is called the \u201csea level equivalent\u201d. While that scenario is extreme, it shows how much water is stored in Antarctica and how important it is to our climate. Antarctic ice sheets are the thermostat of the planet, and that thermostat is controlled by the amount of water frozen in ice sheets. Losing ice sheets creates a negative feedback loop. Ice sheets, shelves and glaciers act as giant reflective surfaces, bouncing sunlight back into space. In doing so, they keep the Earth cool (this is called the albedo effect). But as we lose those vast white surfaces, less of the Sun\u2019s light is reflected away, so the Earth is likely to warm.\u00a0 While the thinning of the Antarctic ice sheets has already been attributed to an increase in ocean temperature, among other causes, research from a multinational scientific research group has shown that ocean warming has driven a major recession of the ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula over the past 9000 years. The group projected the effects of an increase in the ocean temperature of between 0.3C and 1.5C at 50-400m below sea level and suggested that ice shelf melting will increase as a result. \u201cIn order to do this, we had to join our effort, because Antarctica is so big and it's pretty much unexplored,\u201d says Laura de Santis, a marine geologist and former chief officer of the Past Antarctic Ice Sheet (Pais) research programme. Only after the International Geophysical Year, an initiative to improve scientific collaboration in the Antarctic, from 1957-58 did more countries invest money in investigating Antarctica. \u201c[In scientific terms] we have a quite recent story of measurement and scientific investigation in Antarctica.\u201d Image of Pippa Whitehouse (University of Durham, UK) There are three ice sheets in Antarctica, with the vast majority of ice in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). This ice sheet covers most of the Antarctic land mass and has a sea level equivalent of 53.3m (175ft), the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which looks out over the Amundsen Sea, and the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS), which reaches up towards South America, have sea level equivalents of 4.3m (14ft) and 0.2m (0.7ft), respectively. In the centre of the EAIS there is very little snowfall and very little surface melting. For much of the year, this vast expanse is cold and dry. Whereas around the western coast there is a high amount of snowfall and considerable melting. Most ice is lost on the peripheries of the ice sheets, where the ocean melts and breaks off chunks of ice in a process called ocean forcing. The rate at which ice is lost to the ocean is increasing. At the moment, most of this mass loss is coming from the WAIS. \u201cAround the majority of West Antarctica, ice flows directly into the ocean,\u201d says Pippa Whitehouse, a geographer, ice sheet modeller and former chief officer of Solid Earth Response and influence on Cryospheric Evolution (Serce), another research programme led by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar). \u201cThe ice is sitting on the seafloor, which is really fundamental for how it responds to climate forcing. As we warm the ocean, that ocean is flowing right up next to the ice sheet and melting it from underneath.\u201d Image of Laura de Santis (INOGS, Italy) Sea ice and ice shelves (extensions of ice sheets over water) do not have a sea level equivalent. As they are already floating on the ocean, if they were to melt, they would not change the sea level (like a melting ice cube in a drink, the volume stays the same). But ice shelves still play an important role in protecting Antarctica, says Whitehouse. They buttress the ice sheets that feed into them and once this barrier is removed the flow of ice sheets to the ocean greatly accelerates the delivery of landed ice into the ocean, raising sea levels. \u201cIf we lose those buttresses, the rate at which we will lose more ice from ice sheets will increase,\u201d says Whitehouse. Pais, Serce and the Instabilities and Thresholds in Antarctica (Instant) research programmes of Scar unite scientists from 45 member countries, including geologists, chemists, biologists and economists to analyse the interactions of the oceans, atmosphere and cryosphere to make reconstructions of ice sheet mass from the past and projections of ice sheet mass in the future. \u201cWe need to combine multidisciplinary work in order to understand the sensitivity of the ice sheets to ongoing climate warming, and to even more warming, which is expected in the future in the next decades,\u201d says de Santis. Image of Tim Naish - Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand Each expert brings unique research interests that expand our understanding of how climate change affects different systems. By drilling deep into the frozen Antarctic ground, a whole new world appears. About 90 million years ago, in the Cretaceous period, Antarctica was a lush swamp. Samples from the earth beneath the ice contain pollen, spores and roots.\u00a0 Despite its frigid appearance, the seafloor around the Antarctic is home to tiny microorganisms. Some life even survives below the ice, like the algae and tardigrades in sub-glacial Antarctic lakes. While the focus of research in the Antarctic is on ice sheet modelling and the effect of ice loss on sea levels, there is also a home for biologists and ecologists on Scar\u2019s projects. The effects of climate change are likely to result in greater changes at the Earth\u2019s poles than the global average, in a process called polar amplification. The Pais project found that polar amplification will accelerate, meaning the ratio of warming at the poles compared to the rest of the world will increase. \u201cThe science suggests that [ice sheet melting] is unstable and potentially irreversible on human timescales,\u201d says Tim Naish, a paleoclimatologist and chief officer of Instant. \u201cWhat we're seeing in satellite data and ocean measurements is that where the ocean is beginning to warm around the coast of Antarctica, ice is flowing into that warm ocean, and those ice sheets are beginning to break up.\u201d Naish says the next step is to communicate that message more widely. \u201cA big part of what we do is explaining the impact of these changes on humanity, on society.\u201d \u201cScientific research just can't be done in back offices anymore,\u201d says Naish. \u201cIt needs to be done in a co-produced co-designed way with those who use that science as well.

At the moment, most of this mass loss is coming from the WAIS.\n\n\u201cAround the majority of West Antarctica, ice flows directly into the ocean,\u201d says Pippa Whitehouse, a geographer, ice sheet modeller and former chief officer of Solid Earth Response and influence on Cryospheric Evolution (Serce), another research programme led by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar). \u201cThe ice is sitting on the seafloor, which is really fundamental for how it responds to climate forcing. As we warm the ocean, that ocean is flowing right up next to the ice sheet and melting it from underneath.\u201d\n\nSea ice and ice shelves (extensions of ice sheets over water) do not have a sea level equivalent. As they are already floating on the ocean, if they were to melt, they would not change the sea level (like a melting ice cube in a drink, the volume stays the same). But ice shelves still play an important role in protecting Antarctica, says Whitehouse. They buttress the ice sheets that feed into them and once this barrier is removed the flow of ice sheets to the ocean greatly accelerates the delivery of landed ice into the ocean, raising sea levels. \u201cIf we lose those buttresses, the rate at which we will lose more ice from ice sheets will increase,\u201d says Whitehouse.\n\nPais, Serce and the Instabilities and Thresholds in Antarctica (Instant) research programmes of Scar unite scientists from 45 member countries, including geologists, chemists, biologists and economists to analyse the interactions of the oceans, atmosphere and cryosphere to make reconstructions of ice sheet mass from the past and projections of ice sheet mass in the future. \u201cWe need to combine multidisciplinary work in order to understand the sensitivity of the ice sheets to ongoing climate warming, and to even more warming, which is expected in the future in the next decades,\u201d says de Santis.\n\nEach expert brings unique research interests that expand our understanding of how climate change affects different systems. By drilling deep into the frozen Antarctic ground, a whole new world appears. About 90 million years ago, in the Cretaceous period, Antarctica was a lush swamp. Samples from the earth beneath the ice contain pollen, spores and roots.  Despite its frigid appearance, the seafloor around the Antarctic is home to tiny microorganisms. Some life even survives below the ice, like the algae and tardigrades in sub-glacial Antarctic lakes. While the focus of research in the Antarctic is on ice sheet modelling and the effect of ice loss on sea levels, there is also a home for biologists and ecologists on Scar\u2019s projects.\n\nThe effects of climate change are likely to result in greater changes at the Earth\u2019s poles than the global average, in a process called polar amplification. The Pais project found that polar amplification will accelerate, meaning the ratio of warming at the poles compared to the rest of the world will increase. \u201cThe science suggests that [ice sheet melting] is unstable and potentially irreversible on human timescales,\u201d says Tim Naish, a paleoclimatologist and chief officer of Instant. \u201cWhat we're seeing in satellite data and ocean measurements is that where the ocean is beginning to warm around the coast of Antarctica, ice is flowing into that warm ocean, and those ice sheets are beginning to break up.\u201d Naish says the next step is to communicate that message more widely. \u201cA big part of what we do is explaining the impact of these changes on humanity, on society.\u201d \u201cScientific research just can't be done in back offices anymore,\u201d says Naish. \u201cIt needs to be done in a co-produced co-designed way with those who use that science as well. And I think that's something Scar is becoming more and more aware of.\u201d"

Extreme weather and heat are killing increasing numbers of people, damaging economies and forcing millions around the world to flee their homes, adding to an already unstable geopolitical situation, MPs were told on Tuesday at a select committee hearing. The climate crisis has become a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d that can add to instability and the risk of unrest in many countries and is therefore an international security issue, parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee was told. The increasing dangers of floods, droughts and other damage to vital infrastructure also makes the climate crisis a national security problem within the UK. But while the US has taken a \u201cwhole government\u201d approach to the crisis, ordering the security services to focus on climate risks in their assessments, the UK has lagged behind, according to experts giving evidence. Erin Sikorsky, the director of the Center for Climate and Security in the US, said: \u201cThe US government has put climate change and national security at the front of its foreign security policy agenda under [president Joe] Biden. The Department of Homeland Security has been involved.\u201d Even though most of the Republican party leadership and the former president Donald Trump have been vehemently opposed to action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, when it comes to national security there has been cooperation on the climate. \u201cIt has really been a bipartisan issue for over a decade,\u201d Sikorsky said. Germany has also integrated climate considerations into all government departments. Kira Vinke, of the German Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said. \u201c[There has been a] whole government approach, seeing it through a national security and human security lens.\u201d In the UK, however, not enough has been done to adapt to the impacts of extreme weather and prepare for future risks, said Lady Brown, the chair of the adaptation subcommittee at the government\u2019s statutory adviser, the Climate Change Committee. \u201cWe are not seeing implementation and action,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not very ready at all [for the impacts of extreme weather].\u201d Helen Adams, a senior lecturer on disaster risk reduction at King\u2019s College London, said part of the problem in the UK was that there was not enough interest in the issue from Downing Street. \u201cWe are not acting at scale, things are not getting to a high enough level [of government],\u201d she said. \u201cIt has to come from the top down.\u201d Stark warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, were \u201cnot getting to the highest level\u201d, she warned.

        "title": "Climate change driving demand for predatory loans, research shows",
        "text": "Study connects heatwaves and cold snaps to surges in payday lending, keeping people in debt and harming communities of color Two competing payday loan stores stand on the corners of an intersection in south Los Angeles. An area of persistent poverty, south LA is also a banking desert where payday lenders fill the gap. Long lines form inside the stores on the first of the month, when rent is due. Guillermina Molina, a 60-year-old retired housekeeper, visits the same Speedy Cash each month. During the summer months \u2013 which are becoming increasingly hot \u2013 she runs her air conditioner but frets about her utility bills. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard because the [power bill] is coming up too high because you gotta have the air conditioner on,\u201d Molina said. During heatwaves, Molina\u2019s daughter, Vanessa Vargas, checks in on her every day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pull up to her house and find her [passed out] because of the heat,\u201d she said. Molina doesn\u2019t have savings, so to cover her bills she takes out a $225 payday loan every month, paying $45 in interest on each loan. When she\u2019s unable to pay back her loan on time, she\u2019s charged extra. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over,\u201d Vargas said. Molina\u2019s financial struggles are common. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, 12 million Americans take out payday loans each year, paying $9bn in fees. New research suggests climate change is driving up demand for these loans. A study released earlier this year found that extreme temperature shocks \u2013 like heatwaves and cold snaps \u2013 are leading to surges in demand for payday loans in the US. The paper, published in January by the Bank of Canada, suggests extreme heat and cold may increase demand for payday loans in several ways: increased energy costs as people turn on heating or cooling devices, lost income for people who are unable to work in extreme heat, and health problems leading to medical costs for underinsured or uninsured people. \u201cWe are quite surprised with the fact that there is actually a strong effect stimulating increasing demand during extreme heat and cold days,\u201d said lead author Shihan Xie, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois. Xie\u2019s study looked at satellite temperature data, a dataset of payday loan applications and zip codes to see how temperature affected loans. (The paper has not yet been peer reviewed, but Xie said it will be.) Researchers found that counties with higher populations of Hispanic people, who are overrepresented in outdoor jobs, see larger increases in demand for payday loans with extreme heat days. They also found that loan delinquency and default rates increased with more extreme heat days. Xie said the findings highlight the vulnerability of lower-income households to climate shocks and underscore the need for targeted policies, such as utility assistance programs that could help a consumer like Molina. \u201cWe hope we can provide more evidence on how the program could be better designed to help low-income households,\u201d Xie said. Payday loans are short-term, high-interest loans that are typically $500 or less. The lender typically gives the borrower cash in return for a postdated check timed to coincide with their next paycheck two to four weeks later. Fees are about $15 to $20 per $100 loan, which works out to a 400% to 600% annual percentage rate (APR), according to Xie\u2019s analysis. The interest rates at Speedy Cash, where Molina borrows money, can reach 460%. (Speedy Cash did not reply to requests for comment.) \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at how much they charge over a week or two weeks, it\u2019s not that much. But if you think about it in the annual sense, then the interest rates are extremely high,\u201d Xie said. The loans are widely seen as predatory, with the average customer earning about $30,000 a year and remaining in debt for an average of five months a year, according to a 2012 Pew Charitable Trusts study. One 2021 study found that lenders disproportionately target Black and Latino communities. Payday loans are restricted or outlawed in 18 states and Washington DC, but many lenders find ways around the laws by offering high-interest loans online or operating on sovereign tribal land. Utility bills are among the most common reasons that people take out payday loans. The 2012 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that seven in 10 borrowers use payday loans for recurring expenses like rent and utilities. Another study in 2012 by the Center for Financial Services Innovation found the most common use for short-term loans like payday loans was to cover utility bills. Extreme heat does not affect all communities equally. People who live in urban \u201cheat islands\u201d with fewer trees and parks are at greater risk from heat, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Due to systemic discrimination, like historic redlining, people of color and lower-income residents are more likely to live in heat islands. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Molina lives in a heat island. South LA has little tree cover, and bus stops carry ads warning of heatstroke. The largely lower-income area experiences higher rates of heat-related emergency room visits compared to wealthier areas of the city, according to a University of California, Los Angeles, data analysis. Erika Toriz, founder and CEO of Haven Neighborhood Services, a community group in south Los Angeles, said her clients struggle with an impossible choice: endure heat stress and illness, which can be deadly, or take out payday loans to pay for cooling, which can lead to a cycle of debt. Many of her clients put foil on their windows to reflect sunlight or use wet towels to stay cool. Those with air conditioning avoid running it for too long. \u201cFamilies are worried that their electric bill is going to go up, because they can\u2019t afford that. Even going up $25 is a huge difference,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor our clients, it\u2019s like putting a meal for one or two days on their table.\u201d For some workers, heat can affect their ability to earn a living. A 2021 study found that outdoor workers \u2013 who earn a median annual income of $31,000 a year \u2013 risk losing as much as $1,700 in annual income by mid-century as a result of extreme heat. Kristina Dahl, co-author of the study and principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cOne implication of that lost income from extreme heat could be seeking out payday loans, which have huge interest rates and can really catalyse a cycle of debt.\u201d Black and Hispanic workers are disproportionately affected by extreme heat, facing productivity losses 18% greater than non-Hispanic white workers, according to a 2021 report by the Atlantic Council. \u201cClimate change is just pushing them even further toward this financial brink,\u201d Dahl said. Xie noted that hurricanes and wildfires trigger government aid and insurance that can help households handle financial stress, but heatwaves and cold snaps do not. \u201cThose smaller events still have strong effects on household wellbeing,\u201d she said. Utility assistance programs like the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) can provide some relief, she said, but many households are either unaware that they exist or do not know how to file claims for assistance. \u201cMaking [this] program more widely available and accessible to low-income households could also be one of the strategies\u201d to help people cope with extreme temperatures, Xie said. Vargas said she wasn\u2019t sure whether her mother qualified for California\u2019s Liheap program because she already receives other forms of government assistance. \u201cA lot of these programs, there\u2019s a lot of red tape,\u201d Vargas said. Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Centre, said many states don\u2019t spend enough on low-income energy programs. \u201cThe allocations just don\u2019t cover the need,\u201d she said. Lusson said Xie\u2019s study highlighted the \u201cheat-or-eat conundrum\u201d in which families face difficult choices between paying utility bills or buying groceries and medicine. \u201cWhen you throw in climate change, and the fact that 2023 was the hottest year in the recorded history of the planet, the unaffordability problem can be expected to grow more dire,\u201d she said. Molina is not thinking about the long term \u2013 she\u2019s more focused on her mounting expenses. \u201cIt\u2019s too high: the lights, the gas, even the food,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can I do?

        "onlytext": "Two competing payday loan stores stand on the corners of an intersection in south Los Angeles. An area of persistent poverty, south LA is also a banking desert where payday lenders fill the gap. Long lines form inside the stores on the first of the month, when rent is due. Guillermina Molina, a 60-year-old retired housekeeper, visits the same Speedy Cash each month. During the summer months \u2013 which are becoming increasingly hot \u2013 she runs her air conditioner but frets about her utility bills. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard because the [power bill] is coming up too high because you gotta have the air conditioner on,\u201d Molina said. During heatwaves, Molina\u2019s daughter, Vanessa Vargas, checks in on her every day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pull up to her house and find her [passed out] because of the heat,\u201d she said. Molina doesn\u2019t have savings, so to cover her bills she takes out a $225 payday loan every month, paying $45 in interest on each loan. When she\u2019s unable to pay back her loan on time, she\u2019s charged extra. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over,\u201d Vargas said. Molina\u2019s financial struggles are common. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, 12 million Americans take out payday loans each year, paying $9bn in fees. New research suggests climate change is driving up demand for these loans. A study released earlier this year found that extreme temperature shocks \u2013 like heatwaves and cold snaps \u2013 are leading to surges in demand for payday loans in the US. The paper, published in January by the Bank of Canada, suggests extreme heat and cold may increase demand for payday loans in several ways: increased energy costs as people turn on heating or cooling devices, lost income for people who are unable to work in extreme heat, and health problems leading to medical costs for underinsured or uninsured people. \u201cWe are quite surprised with the fact that there is actually a strong effect stimulating increasing demand during extreme heat and cold days,\u201d said lead author Shihan Xie, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois. Xie\u2019s study looked at satellite temperature data, a dataset of payday loan applications and zip codes to see how temperature affected loans. Researchers found that counties with higher populations of Hispanic people, who are overrepresented in outdoor jobs, see larger increases in demand for payday loans with extreme heat days. They also found that loan delinquency and default rates increased with more extreme heat days. Xie said the findings highlight the vulnerability of lower-income households to climate shocks and underscore the need for targeted policies, such as utility assistance programs that could help a consumer like Molina. \u201cWe hope we can provide more evidence on how the program could be better designed to help low-income households,\u201d Xie said. Payday loans are short-term, high-interest loans that are typically $500 or less. The lender typically gives the borrower cash in return for a postdated check timed to coincide with their next paycheck two to four weeks later. Fees are about $15 to $20 per $100 loan, which works out to a 400% to 600% annual percentage rate (APR), according to Xie\u2019s analysis. The interest rates at Speedy Cash, where Molina borrows money, can reach 460%. Utility bills are among the most common reasons that people take out payday loans. The 2012 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that seven in 10 borrowers use payday loans for recurring expenses like rent and utilities. Another study in 2012 by the Center for Financial Services Innovation found the most common use for short-term loans like payday loans was to cover utility bills. Extreme heat does not affect all communities equally. People who live in urban \u201cheat islands\u201d with fewer trees and parks are at greater risk from heat, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Due to systemic discrimination, like historic redlining, people of color and lower-income residents are more likely to live in heat islands. Molina lives in a heat island. South LA has little tree cover, and bus stops carry ads warning of heatstroke. The largely lower-income area experiences higher rates of heat-related emergency room visits compared to wealthier areas of the city, according to a University of California, Los Angeles, data analysis. Erika Toriz, founder and CEO of Haven Neighborhood Services, a community group in south Los Angeles, said her clients struggle with an impossible choice: endure heat stress and illness, which can be deadly, or take out payday loans to pay for cooling, which can lead to a cycle of debt. Many of her clients put foil on their windows to reflect sunlight or use wet towels to stay cool. Those with air conditioning avoid running it for too long. \u201cFamilies are worried that their electric bill is going to go up, because they can\u2019t afford that. Even going up $25 is a huge difference,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor our clients, it\u2019s like putting a meal for one or two days on their table.\u201d For some workers, heat can affect their ability to earn a living. A 2021 study found that outdoor workers \u2013 who earn a median annual income of $31,000 a year \u2013 risk losing as much as $1,700 in annual income by mid-century as a result of extreme heat. Kristina Dahl, co-author of the study and principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cOne implication of that lost income from extreme heat could be seeking out payday loans, which have huge interest rates and can really catalyse a cycle of debt.\u201d Black and Hispanic workers are disproportionately affected by extreme heat, facing productivity losses 18% greater than non-Hispanic white workers, according to a 2021 report by the Atlantic Council. \u201cClimate change is just pushing them even further toward this financial brink,\u201d Dahl said. Xie noted that hurricanes and wildfires trigger government aid and insurance that can help households handle financial stress, but heatwaves and cold snaps do not. \u201cThose smaller events still have strong effects on household wellbeing,\u201d she said. Utility assistance programs like the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) can provide some relief, she said, but many households are either unaware that they exist or do not know how to file claims for assistance. \u201cMaking [this] program more widely available and accessible to low-income households could also be one of the strategies\u201d to help people cope with extreme temperatures, Xie said.

        "text": "In the country\u2019s south, up to half of the annual predicted rain fell in just 10 days \u2013 the third such event in a year. Experts say it is time to plan for a new normal When the torrential rain began to swallow her city block, Cristiane Batista, 34, grabbed her three children, a couple of backpacks and her smartphone and waited at the door, hoping to be picked up by the municipal trucks preparing to evacuate the population of Mu\u00e7um, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. \u201cI was terrified. The house was about to flood. We had to get out of there,\u201d she says. Batista, her husband, Jeferson, 34, and their children \u2013 who range in age from one to eight \u2013 had already been victims of the extreme weather of Brazil\u2019s southernmost state twice last year. In September 2023, Mu\u00e7um and its nearly 5,000 inhabitants were at the centre of the devastation caused by floods, which left scores of people \u2013 including 15 people in a single Mu\u00e7um house. \u201cWe lost everything,\u201d she says. Two months later, the city was hit by another fierce bout of rain. The storm destroyed furniture and appliances and left walls stained with mud. After losing everything for the third time, she says she no longer has the strength to live in the city. Rio Grande do Sul, a state home to almost 11 million people, has witnessed the most extensive climate catastrophe in its history and one of the greatest in Brazil\u2019s recent history. Over the course of 10 days at the end of April and beginning of May, the region recorded between a third and almost half of the yearly rainfall predicted \u2013 between 500 and 700 millimetres, depending on the area, according to measurements by Metsul Meteorologia. The storm caused the Taquari, Ca\u00ed, Pardo, Jacu\u00ed, Sinos, and Gravata\u00ed rivers \u2013 tributaries of the Gua\u00edba \u2013 to overflow. According to the Civil Defence, there are more than 100 people dead, more than a 130 missing, and nearly 400 people injured in 425 affected municipalities. At least 232,125 people have left their homes: 67,542 are in shelters, and 164,583 are homeless or temporarily staying with family or friends. Cities such as Eldorado do Sul, Roca Sales, and Canoas were partly flooded, and villages such as Cruzeiro do Sul were devastated in what the state governor, Eduardo Leite, described as \u201cthe greatest catastrophe of all\u201d. Porto Alegre, the state capital and one of Brazil\u2019s largest urban centres, is one of the worst-affected cities. On 5 May, the level of the Gua\u00edba River, which runs through the city, reached a record of 5.35 meters, surpassing the 4.76 meters reached during the historic floods of 1941. Neighbourhoods close to the river were submerged. The airport closed, and power and water-treatment plants went down, causing electricity and drinking water shortages in several areas. A dam in a northern suburb failed and flooded a large portion of the city. Viewed from an army helicopter, the neighbouring city of Eldorado do Sul looks like a set of canals stretching along narrow strips of land and buildings. About 90% of the city is underwater. Along the BR-290 highway, one of the most critical roads in the country\u2019s south, hundreds of people are waiting for transport to shelters. \u201cWe knew it would be a unique event, and the river would overflow within a few days. We did simulations with the data we recorded, and the result was terrifying. So we alerted the authorities,\u201d says Joel Goldenfum, the director of the Institute of Hydraulic Research at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, who is leading research on the unfolding catastrophe in Porto Alegre. Infrastructure is key to understanding what happened in the state capital, says Goldenfum, explaining that an extended network of 42 miles (68 kilometres) of dykes, gates, a containment wall at the dock, and more than 20 drainage pumps prevented a more severe situation. However, the lack of maintenance of the flood protection system over the years may have been a factor. \u201cThis system has worked well, but it has already shown sealing problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThe gates and pump houses have already shown weaknesses. There have been maintenance problems, so the system hasn\u2019t held up.\u201d Extreme floods were relatively uncommon in Rio Grande do Sul. However, scientists believe that climate factors are now accelerating such events. These include an intense wind current in the region, which destabilised the climate; an atmospheric block, which emerged after a heatwave that made the centre of Brazil drier, concentrating the rain in the country\u2019s northern and southern extremes; and a moisture corridor from the Amazon, which strengthened the torrential rain. Twenty years ago, a study produced by the climate researchers Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo and Wagner Rodrigues Soares identified a significant increase in precipitation in southern Brazil and warned of its consequences. A more recent study published by the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) indicated that the number of days Porto Alegre suffers \u201cextreme precipitation\u201d \u2013 rainfall above 50 millimetres \u2013 has more than doubled since the 1960s. From 1961 to 1970, there were 29 days a year. This number increased to 44 days between 2001 and 2010 and rose to 66 days from 2011 to 2020. \u201cThese climate events gain power as we have El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a periods. Over time, we have seen that the rainfall regime and temperatures are different,\u201d s Marcelo Dutra da Silva, a professor of ecology at the Federal University of Rio Grande and one of the country\u2019s leading figures warning about climate effects. \u201cThis is creating climate and ecological troubles and an economic problem.\u201d In June 2022, Dutra warned public authorities that cities in the southern region were not prepared for natural disasters. \u201cThere is no planning for risk areas, for flood areas. There is absolutely no environmental planning to consider the climate changes and events happening,\u201d he said. Carlos Nobre, a renowned climatologist, principal investigator at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IEA) of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and the co-chair of the Science Panel for the Amazon, says climate models had already indicated the risk of increased rainfall in southern Brazil. The higher the average temperature, the more intense the ocean\u2019s evaporation, bringing more water into the atmosphere and thus facilitating the occurrence and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, he says. \u201cWhat we have seen happen is absolutely devastating,\u201d Nobre says. \u201cWe have data on this in Brazil: due to climate change, the forecast is for increased rainfall [in the southern regions].\u201d For Nobre, a critical problem for regions suffering climate events such as extreme floods is that \u201cthe infrastructures were built for a climate that no longer exists\u201d. He says it is time for governments to reconsider planning better adaptation to avoid future catastrophes. Another study, produced in 2015 during the administration of President Dilma Rousseff, showed projections that now seem closer to our climate reality: heatwaves, water scarcity in south-east Brazil and intense rainfall in the south. Natalie Unterstell, an expert in climate change policy and negotiations and one of the study\u2019s authors, says the extreme floods in the Rio Grande do Sul are precisely what she has been warning about for years. \u201cWhat is happening today in Rio Grande do Sul is our new reality and not a \u2018sad exception\u2019,\u201d she posted on Instagram. Brazil\u2019s presidency says that it is not possible to estimate the exact extent of the current damage and how much reconstruction will cost as the water has not receded. \u201cThe country will spare no effort to assist in the reconstruction and resettlement of people who have lost their homes,\u201d itsaid in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that there will be properties that cannot be rebuilt in the same location due to the risk of new floods.\u201d However, on Thursday the state governor announced his first estimate of the damage : about 19bn reals (\u00a32.9bn), which is expected to rise in the coming days and weeks. Leite \u2013 who has relaxed nearly 500 environmental protection regulations since 2019 when he took office \u2013 says his administration will develop a housing plan for people affected by the flood. He had previously said that the state would need \u201ca Marshall plan\u201d to recover, referring to the American programme to rebuild after the second world war. The mayor of Porto Alegre, Sebasti\u00e3o Melo, says his administration has carried out maintenance but acknowledged that the flood prevention system \u201cis old\u201d. Amid increasing public pressure for political leaders to be held accountable for their indifference to adapting to the climate crisis, Melo says his efforts are focused on the rescue operations and the displaced shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to look for culprits,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to seek solutions.\u201d",

We did simulations with the data we recorded, and the result was terrifying. So we alerted the authorities,\u201d says Joel Goldenfum, the director of the Institute of Hydraulic Research at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, who is leading research on the unfolding catastrophe in Porto Alegre.\n\nInfrastructure is key to understanding what happened in the state capital, says Goldenfum, explaining that an extended network of 42 miles (68 kilometres) of dykes, gates, a containment wall at the dock, and more than 20 drainage pumps prevented a more severe situation. However, the lack of maintenance of the flood protection system over the years may have been a factor. \u201cThis system has worked well, but it has already shown sealing problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThe gates and pump houses have already shown weaknesses. There have been maintenance problems, so the system hasn\u2019t held up.\u201d\n\nExtreme floods were relatively uncommon in Rio Grande do Sul. However, scientists believe that climate factors are now accelerating such events. These include an intense wind current in the region, which destabilised the climate; an atmospheric block, which emerged after a heatwave that made the centre of Brazil drier, concentrating the rain in the country\u2019s northern and southern extremes; and a moisture corridor from the Amazon, which strengthened the torrential rain. Twenty years ago, a study produced by the climate researchers Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo and Wagner Rodrigues Soares identified a significant increase in precipitation in southern Brazil and warned of its consequences.\n\nA more recent study published by the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) indicated that the number of days Porto Alegre suffers \u201cextreme precipitation\u201d \u2013 rainfall above 50 millimetres \u2013 has more than doubled since the 1960s. From 1961 to 1970, there were 29 days a year. This number increased to 44 days between 2001 and 2010 and rose to 66 days from 2011 to 2020. \u201cThese climate events gain power as we have El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a periods. Over time, we have seen that the rainfall regime and temperatures are different,\u201d says Marcelo Dutra da Silva, a professor of ecology at the Federal University of Rio Grande and one of the country\u2019s leading figures warning about climate effects. \u201cThis is creating climate and ecological troubles and an economic problem.\u201d\n\nIn June 2022, Dutra warned public authorities that cities in the southern region were not prepared for natural disasters. \u201cThere is no planning for risk areas, for flood areas. There is absolutely no environmental planning to consider the climate changes and events happening,\u201d he said. Carlos Nobre, a renowned climatologist, principal investigator at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IEA) of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and the co-chair of the Science Panel for the Amazon, says climate models had already indicated the risk of increased rainfall in southern Brazil. The higher the average temperature, the more intense the ocean\u2019s evaporation, bringing more water into the atmosphere and thus facilitating the occurrence and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, he says. \u201cWhat we have seen happen is absolutely devastating,\u201d Nobre says. \u201cWe have data on this in Brazil: due to climate change, the forecast is for increased rainfall [in the southern regions].\u201d\n\nFor Nobre, a critical problem for regions suffering climate events such as extreme floods is that \u201cthe infrastructures were built for a climate that no longer exists\u201d. He says it is time for governments to reconsider planning better adaptation to avoid future catastrophes. Another study, produced in 2015 during the administration of President Dilma Rousseff, showed projections that now seem closer to our climate reality: heatwaves, water scarcity in south-east Brazil and intense rainfall in the south. Natalie Unterstell, an expert in climate change policy and negotiations and one of the study\u2019s authors, says the extreme floods in the Rio Grande do Sul are precisely what she has been warning about for years. \u201cWhat is happening today in Rio Grande do Sul is our new reality and not a \u2018sad exception\u2019,\u201d she posted on Instagram.\n\nBrazil\u2019s presidency says that it is not possible to estimate the exact extent of the current damage and how much reconstruction will cost as the water has not receded. \u201cThe country will spare no effort to assist in the reconstruction and resettlement of people who have lost their homes,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that there will be properties that cannot be rebuilt in the same location due to the risk of new floods.\u201d However, on Thursday the state governor announced his first estimate of the damage: about 19bn reals (\u00a32.9bn), which is expected to rise in the coming days and weeks. Leite \u2013 who has relaxed nearly 500 environmental protection regulations since 2019 when he took office \u2013 says his administration will develop a housing plan for people affected by the flood. He had previously said that the state would need \u201ca Marshall plan\u201d to recover, referring to the American programme to rebuild after the second world war.\n\nThe mayor of Porto Alegre, Sebasti\u00e3o Melo, says his administration has carried out maintenance but acknowledged that the flood prevention system \u201cis old\u201d. Amid increasing public pressure for political leaders to be held accountable for their indifference to adapting to the climate crisis, Melo says his efforts are focused on the rescue operations and the displaced shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to look for culprits,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to seek solutions.\u201d"

        "text": "More than 12,000 deaths have already been attributed to glacial lake outburst floods worldwide An increasing number of people are being threatened by flooding caused by glacial lakes bursting, scientists have warned. As the planet warms and glaciers recede, meltwater accumulates and forms lakes, often as a result of ice or moraine acting as a dam. Since 1990, the volume, area and number of these glacial lakes has increased by 50% globally. When these lakes become too full there is a risk that they may breach or overflow, releasing huge volumes of water and causing catastrophic flooding. Some lakes are more dangerous than others, and more likely to result in what are known as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Stephan Harrison, a professor of climate and environmental change at Exeter University, said: \u201cThe ones we\u2019re concerned about are the very steep mountain valleys in the Andes and in the Himalayas, where you have glaciers retreating up into their steep valleys with lots of opportunity for bits of mountainside to fall off into lakes.\u201d The correlation between rising temperatures and glacial lake outburst floods is complicated. While glacial lake formation and growth can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, the triggers that can cause disastrous flooding are often down to non-climatic factors such as moraine dam geometry, earthquakes, ice or rock avalanches into the lake or extreme rainfall. Adam Emmer, a geographer at the University of Graz in Austria, said: \u201cYou need two conditions to generate a disaster \u2013 high magnitude GLOF, and exposed population as well as assets in its path. Population expansion along the potential GLOF paths and lack of building development regulations may be even more important driver of GLOF risk, especially in developing countries.\u201d One of the parameters that makes a glacial lake potentially dangerous is the size of downstream population that could be exposed to flooding, and that number can range from few hundreds to hundreds of thousands, as in the case of Huaraz city located downstream of Lake Palcacocha in Peru. However, the many factors at play in an outburst flood make it impossible to estimate how many people might be at risk globally. A 2016 study found there have been at least 1,348 recorded glacial lake outburst floods so far worldwide, of which 24% had some societal impact. More than 12,000 deaths have been attributed to such floods. Central Asia was the most affected region, followed by South America, then the European Alps, Iceland, Scandinavia, north-west America and Greenland. The authors identify South America and central Asia as the regions most likely to experience large numbers of deaths, extreme damage to infrastructure, flooding of farmlands and the destruction of homes and roads. Of the world\u2019s tropical glaciers, 70% are situated in Peruvian Andes, and they are melting rapidly, which has led to several glacial disasters over recent decades. The worst so far was the 1941 glacial lake outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha, which claimed at least 1,800 lives. Subsequently, Peru started working on lake monitoring and implementation of hazard mitigation measures such as draining lakes, strengthening unstable moraine dams with concrete structures and artificial spillways, and installing early warning systems as early as the 1950s. \u201cPeruvian Cordillera Blanca [part of the Andes mountain range] is, in fact, the world\u2019s pioneer region of GLOF mitigation works,\u201d said Emmer. Despite this, \u201cthe biggest challenge is yet to come \u2013 communicating the risk and risk reduction measures to local communities and making them trust and accept it\u201d, he added. Nepal, which is also highly vulnerable to glacial floods, started taking interest in GLOFs after two serious floods in the 1980s. In 1999, Nepal drained a rapidly expanding lake called Tsho Rolpa near Mount Everest to lower the lake levels, a first in the region. \u201cGLOF has been recognised as a big challenge for Nepal. In the past, there also have been efforts made to reduce the risk from individual lakes and two lakes have already been intervened in [around] the Everest region,\u201d said Arun Shrestha, a climate change specialist at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. According to Shrestha, Nepal has documented records of up to 35 GLOF events, but the true number is probably higher. International communication and cooperation is also critical to preventing deadly floods; a study published last year identified 47 potentially dangerous glacial lakes that could affect Nepal if breached, but only 21 were in Nepal itself. Twenty-five were also identified in China and one in India. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that Nepal talks with China and tries to address those issues,\u201d said Shrestha. \u201cThose lakes cannot be ignored, but for that, a bilateral diplomatic effort is required. With climate change, and infrastructure and settlements changing quite rapidly, I think the risk is growing every day.\u201d Despite the rapid recession of glaciers worldwide, the frequency of GLOFs has actually declined globally. Scientists attribute this trend to a lag between climate change and the occurrence of GLOFs. Scientists predict an increase in GLOFs starting in the coming decades and extending well into the early 22nd century.

        "title": "The world\u2019s historic sites face climate change. Can Petra lead the way?",
        "text": "Premium Content The 2,000-year-old desert city created an adventurous backdrop for Indiana Jones, but today, drought, floods, and sandstorms imperil it. Ancient technology could be the key to surviving. When he was a boy growing up in Wadi Musa, a town in southern Jordan, Mohamad Alfarajat says his father told him stories of green terraces planted with wheat in the region\u2019s desert canyons, along with thriving apricot orchards and fig trees that fed the local community. Alfarajat, now a geologist at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University in nearby Ma\u2019an, Jordan, says little of that bounty remains. Longer and longer dry spells have made it harder to maintain the fields that fed his father and generations before him. \u201cSince climate change started 40 years ago, the fertile areas started to contract,\u201d Alfarajat says. \u201cThe community used to grow its own food on its own land, and now they import nearly everything from outside.\u201d As drought has made local agriculture precarious, climate change has also made flash flooding more frequent, threatening both the area\u2019s ancient ruins and local communities. And more intense temperature swings have accelerated the weathering of historic sandstone facades that were carved at the height of the Roman Empire. \u201cThe impact of climate change at Wadi Musa is very clear,\u201d says Alfarajat. \u201cIf you want to see climate change impacts in front of your face, come to Petra.\u201d Wadi Musa has changed in other ways since Alfarajat was a boy. Since the 1980s, the nearby archaeological site of Petra has turned into a global tourism hotspot. Nearly a million visitors visit Petra each year to marvel at the tombs and temples cut into sandstone by the Nabatean civilization almost 2,000 years ago. They, too, are threatened by flash floods, and damage to the archaeological site would endanger the tourism business locals have come to rely on. To protect the site in decades to come, Petra\u2019s guardians are turning to ancient solutions, including technology left behind by the people who originally built the remarkable desert outpost. The mountains around Petra are shaped like a bowl, with the ancient city at the center. Elevation across the sprawling, 100-square-mile site varies by more than 3,000 feet. When it rains in the region, water quickly makes its way downhill\u2014often resulting in catastrophic, even deadly, flash floods. People in the area still talk about the winter of 1963, when floods took people at the site by surprise and killed dozens of locals and tourists. In 2018, rushing water again sent boulders tumbling through the ravines around Wadi Musa.   As recently as December 2022, fast-moving walls of water coursed through Petra\u2019s narrow canyons, sloshing muddy water all the way up to the steps of the iconic Treasury, an ancient building made famous as an exterior in \u201cIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\u201d \u201cWater came from four directions, directly into the Treasury,\u201d says Taher Falahat, a cultural heritage expert at the Petra Development Tourism Regional Authority, the agency that manages Petra and the surrounding area. Research shows the Nabateans, too, had to deal with seasonal flooding and drought. Desert traders who ruled the region until around 300 A.D., the Nabateans were a key link in the trade in luxury goods between the Roman Empire and their neighbors to the east. The features that made the area around Wadi Musa attractive for the ancient Nabateans\u2014its winding canyons, high peaks and plateaus, and protected valleys\u2014also make it vulnerable to flooding today. \u201cThey faced the same problems, they had the same topography,\u201d Falahat says. Archaeologists have spent decades tracing the ways Nabateans managed water in the region. They discovered that Nabatean engineers came up with an interlocking system of terraces and small dams to flood-proof ancient Petra. The elaborate system channels water through the many ravines and canyons in and around Petra and Wadi Musa. The dams slow the rushing water that leads to flooding, channeling it into storage ponds. Terraces, meanwhile, soaked up water and provided space for crops. Once the Nabatean kingdom collapsed in the fourth century AD, the system was neglected and fell into disrepair. Even after Petra was rediscovered by archaeologists and developed as a tourist destination in the 20th century, researchers overlooked the dams, focusing instead on the magnificent architecture cut into the cliffs of Petra\u2019s canyons. \u201cThey\u2019ve been left alone for thousands of years,\u201d Falahat says. \u201cThey\u2019re all still there, they\u2019ve just fallen apart.\u201d (The city of Rome wasn't built for today's climate. Is there time to save it?) Plans to revive them are part of the recommendations of a new, National Geographic Society-funded effort to help Petra and other cultural heritage sites around the world adapt to climate change. Called Preserving Legacies, the project aims to help communities protect their heritage sites from climate change. \u201cWe build local climate models and talk to community leaders about what\u2019s most important to save,\u201d says the project\u2019s leader, geographer, and National Geographic Explorer Victoria Herrmann. It\u2019s a crucial effort. As the Earth\u2019s climate shifts, once-in-a-century events like the deadly floods that hit Petra in 1963 are likely to get more frequent, with rainfall in the region increasing by an estimated 40 percent by 2050. \u201cFlooding, which has always been part of Petra\u2019s story, will get more intense,\u201d Herrmann says. That\u2019s not the only risk Petra\u2019s guardians must prepare for: Already at the limit of its desert ecosystem, the wheat and fruit orchards that remain will be further stressed by drought as temperatures steadily rise and heatwaves get more frequent. Sandstorms, too, are expected to increase in size, frequency, and severity, potentially eating away at the sandstone facades of Petra\u2019s tombs and temples. Blowing sand and the dramatic changes in temperature between night and day, meanwhile, crack and crumble the sandstone structures. In other parts of the world, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and other disasters threaten cultural sites in ways scientists are just beginning to understand. \u201cThere will be increasing drought and temperatures, and increasing floods,\u201d says Salma Sabour, a physical and environmental engineer working as the Preserving Legacies project's science director. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t find in the science is the risk as perceived by communities and how they can respond.\u201d The Petra work is a sort of pilot project to show how adapting and responding to climate change can make a big difference to heritage sites. In a report released today, the Preserving Legacies team says the risks to Petra over the coming decades are moderate\u2014 \u201cnot because hazards are not there,\u201d Sabour says, \u201cbut because the community and authorities have been exploring creative ways to adapt, and training people to respond.\u201d (Climate change is threatening Alaska's artifacts. Learn more.) The authorities who manage Petra and the surrounding area have put in place extensive training programs and evacuation drills to make sure park staff are prepared for floods. A digital warning system tracks rainfall and sounds an alarm when conditions are ripe for flooding. During the floods that hit the site in late 2022, the preparation paid off\u20141,700 tourists and staff were evacuated from Petra in a matter of hours, with no reported injuries. Lessons from the past are also being used to help adapt to extreme conditions in the future. \u201cThere is ancient wisdom physically built into the site,\u201d Herrmann says. \u201cCombined with modern solutions, that Nabatean water management system has the greatest potential for adapting Petra to flash floods.\u201d Over the past three years, Falahat has worked with people from the local community to repair and revive the Nabateans\u2019 handiwork, cleaning and repairing the ancient dams and terraces. The work, which has to be repeated each year to clear mud and rocks that build up over the winter rainy season, creates employment while helping safeguard the site. The effort has given Falahat a new appreciation for the work of the Nabateans. \u201cNow my passion is Nabatean terraces,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThey were geniuses at collecting water. Walking in the steps of the Nabateans, we can solve this problem.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "Modularized": "Here is the modularized article:\n\nModule 1:\nWhen he was a boy growing up in Wadi Musa, a town in southern Jordan, Mohamad Alfarajat says his father told him stories of green terraces planted with wheat in the region\u2019s desert canyons, along with thriving apricot orchards and fig trees that fed the local community. Alfarajat, now a geologist at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University in nearby Ma\u2019an, Jordan, says little of that bounty remains. Longer and longer dry spells have made it harder to maintain the fields that fed his father and generations before him. \u201cSince climate change started 40 years ago, the fertile areas started to contract,\u201d Alfarajat says. \u201cThe community used to grow its own food on its own land, and now they import nearly everything from outside.\u201d\n\nModule 2:\nAs drought has made local agriculture precarious, climate change has also made flash flooding more frequent, threatening both the area\u2019s ancient ruins and local communities. And more intense temperature swings have accelerated the weathering of historic sandstone facades that were carved at the height of the Roman Empire. \u201cThe impact of climate change at Wadi Musa is very clear,\u201d says Alfarajat. \u201cIf you want to see climate change impacts in front of your face, come to Petra.\u201d\n\nModule 3:\nWadi Musa has changed in other ways since Alfarajat was a boy. Since the 1980s, the nearby archaeological site of Petra has turned into a global tourism hotspot. Nearly a million visitors visit Petra each year to marvel at the tombs and temples cut into sandstone by the Nabatean civilization almost 2,000 years ago. They, too, are threatened by flash floods, and damage to the archaeological site would endanger the tourism business locals have come to rely on.\n\nModule 4:\nTo protect the site in decades to come, Petra\u2019s guardians are turning to ancient solutions, including technology left behind by the people who originally built the remarkable desert outpost. The mountains around Petra are shaped like a bowl, with the ancient city at the center. Elevation across the sprawling, 100-square-mile site varies by more than 3,000 feet. When it rains in the region, water quickly makes its way downhill\u2014often resulting in catastrophic, even deadly, flash floods.\n\nModule 5:\nPeople in the area still talk about the winter of 1963, when floods took people at the site by surprise and killed dozens of locals and tourists. In 2018, rushing water again sent boulders tumbling through the ravines around Wadi Musa. As recently as December 2022, fast-moving walls of water coursed through Petra\u2019s narrow canyons, sloshing muddy water all the way up to the steps of the iconic Treasury, an ancient building made famous as an exterior in \u201cIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\u201d\n\nModule 6:\nResearch shows the Nabateans, too, had to deal with seasonal flooding and drought. Desert traders who ruled the region until around 300 A.D., the Nabateans were a key link in the trade in luxury goods between the Roman Empire and their neighbors to the east. The features that made the area around Wadi Musa attractive for the ancient Nabateans\u2014its winding canyons, high peaks and plateaus, and protected valleys\u2014also make it vulnerable to flooding today.\n\nModule 7:\nArchaeologists have spent decades tracing the ways Nabateans managed water in the region. They discovered that Nabatean engineers came up with an interlocking system of terraces and small dams to flood-proof ancient Petra. The elaborate system channels water through the many ravines and canyons in and around Petra and Wadi Musa. The dams slow the rushing water that leads to flooding, channeling it into storage ponds. Terraces, meanwhile, soaked up water and provided space for crops.\n\nModule 8:\nOnce the Nabatean kingdom collapsed in the fourth century AD, the system was neglected and fell into disrepair. Even after Petra was rediscovered by archaeologists and developed as a tourist destination in the 20th century, researchers overlooked the dams, focusing instead on the magnificent architecture cut into the cliffs of Petra\u2019s canyons.\n\nModule 9:\nPlans to revive them are part of the recommendations of a new, National Geographic Society-funded effort to help Petra and other cultural heritage sites around the world adapt to climate change. Called Preserving Legacies, the project aims to help communities protect their heritage sites from climate change.\n\nModule 10:\n\u201cWe build local climate models and talk to community leaders about what\u2019s most important to save,\u201d says the project\u2019s leader, geographer, and National Geographic Explorer Victoria Herrmann. It\u2019s a crucial effort. As the Earth\u2019s climate shifts, once-in-a-century events like the deadly floods that hit Petra in 1963 are likely to get more frequent, with rainfall in the region increasing by an estimated 40 percent by 2050.\n\nModule 11:\n\u201cFlooding, which has always been part of Petra\u2019s story, will get more intense,\u201d Herrmann says. That\u2019s not the only risk Petra\u2019s guardians must prepare for: Already at the limit of its desert ecosystem, the wheat and fruit orchards that remain will be further stressed by drought as temperatures steadily rise and heatwaves get more frequent. Sandstorms, too, are expected to increase in size, frequency, and severity, potentially eating away at the sandstone facades of Petra\u2019s tombs and temples.\n\nModule 12:\nIn other parts of the world, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and other disasters threaten cultural sites in ways scientists are just beginning to understand. \u201cThere will be increasing drought and temperatures, and increasing floods,\u201d says Salma Sabour, a physical and environmental engineer working as the Preserving Legacies project's science director.\n\nModule 13:\nThe Petra work is a sort of pilot project to show how adapting and responding to climate change can make a big difference to heritage sites. In a report released today, the Preserving Legacies team says the risks to Petra over the coming decades are moderate\u2014 \u201cnot because hazards are not there,\u201d Sabour says, \u201cbut because the community and authorities have been exploring creative ways to adapt, and training people to respond.\u201d\n\nModule 14:\nThe authorities who manage Petra and the surrounding area have put in place extensive training programs and evacuation drills to make sure park staff are prepared for floods. A digital warning system tracks rainfall and sounds an alarm when conditions are ripe for flooding. During the floods that hit the site in late 2022, the preparation paid off\u20141,700 tourists and staff were evacuated from Petra in a matter of hours, with no reported injuries.\n\nModule 15:\nLessons from the past are also being used to help adapt to extreme conditions in the future. \u201cThere is ancient wisdom physically built into the site,\u201d Herrmann says. \u201cCombined with modern solutions, that Nabatean water management system has the greatest potential for adapting Petra to flash floods.\u201d Over the past three years, Falahat has worked with people from the local community to repair and revive the Nabateans\u2019 handiwork, cleaning and repairing the ancient dams and terraces.",

        "text": "Premium Content If everyone\u2019s success depended on it, would you share\u2014or be selfish? I teach undergraduate psychology courses at the University of Maryland, and my classes draw students with diverse interests. But every one of them perks up when I pose this question: Do you want two extra-credit points on your term paper, or six points? I tell my students that the extra-credit offer is part of an exercise illustrating the interconnectedness of choices individuals make in communities. I explain that the exercise was inspired by an ecologist named Garrett Hardin and an address that he delivered 50 years ago this summer, describing what he called \u201cthe tragedy of the commons.\u201d Hardin said that when many individuals act in their own self-interest without regard for society, the effects can be catastrophic. Hardin used the 19th-century convention of \u201cthe commons\u201d\u2014a cattle-grazing pasture that villagers shared\u2014to warn against the overexploitation of communal resources. I\u2019m hoping that my students will grasp the connections between the classroom exercise, Hardin\u2019s ideas, and our planet\u2019s most pressing problems (including climate change). I allow them to choose between two points or six points of extra credit\u2014but there\u2019s a catch. I stipulate that if more than 10 percent of the class members choose six points, no one gets any points. The extra-credit points are analogous to water, fuel, grazing pasture (from Hardin\u2019s analysis), or any natural resource. According to some free market economic theories, if everyone strives for maximum personal benefit, then societies will thrive. By this logic the student\u2019s rational choice would be to pick six points, just as the shepherd\u2019s rational choice would be to use as much grazing pasture as possible. And those who maximize personal consumption aren\u2019t greedy\u2014they\u2019re strategic. But when everyone chooses this path, the common resource is overtaxed, and societies end up with overharvesting, water shortages, or climate change. A possible solution seems simple: If everyone just moderated their consumption, we\u2019d have sustainability. As many of my students say, \u201cIf everyone chooses two points, we\u2019ll all get the points.\u201d And yet, for the first eight years I used this exercise, only one class\u2014of the dozens I taught\u2014stayed under the 10 percent threshold. All the other classes failed. This exercise was developed more than 25 years ago. Professor Steve Drigotas of Johns Hopkins University had been using it for some time when he administered it to me and my classmates in 2005. My class failed too\u2014and I, who had chosen two points, was incredibly frustrated with my peers who had chosen six.   In 2015 one of my students tweeted about the exercise\u2014\u201cWHAT KIND OF PROFESSOR DOES THIS\u201d\u2014and his lament went viral. People around the globe weighed in: Does so many people choosing six points mean it\u2019s human nature to be greedy and selfish? Dylan Selterman teaches students about the tragedy of the commons with this extra-credit exercise: Choose zero, two, or six points to be added to your final paper grade. If more than 10 percent of you choose six points, no one will receive any points. If you choose zero points, you cancel out one of the six-point choosers, who will receive no points. In his class in fall semester 2017, how did students respond? Read on. ZERO POINTS Devin Porter, 21, sociology major \u201cI took the class to get something out of it, not necessarily for the grade. When we didn\u2019t get the extra credit, I felt bad for the people who really needed it, but I wasn\u2019t too surprised. People who chose two made the obvious choice\u2014everyone eats. People who chose six thought they could get away with it.\u201d TWO POINTSRobin Bachkosky, 19, nursing major\u200a\u201cI thought I made a pretty beneficial choice for the class and myself, one that wouldn\u2019t necessarily put the class to any disadvantage but would give me some extra credit. I was a little disappointed that I didn\u2019t get any extra credit just because some of the other kids were selfish and weren\u2019t satisfied with two points.\u201d SIX POINTSGunleen Deol, 18, information systems and psychology major\u200a\u201cI thought that the majority of people would choose two and felt that the rational decision for me to make would be the one that maximizes my personal benefit, which would be six. Considering how my choice affected the rest of the class made me wish that I had chosen two instead.\u201d The class failed the exercise. Actually most people aren\u2019t. But it\u2019s very tricky to get people to cooperate, especially in large groups of complete strangers. After all, if someone else is taking more for themselves (running more water or choosing six points), why shouldn\u2019t I? But if we all think this way, eventually we\u2019ll all lose. Hardin suggested that education might make a difference\u2014that if we teach people about the consequences of taking too much, they might not. I\u2019ve been skeptical about this idea. When my student\u2019s tweet went viral, some colleagues said that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use the exercise again (because students would already know how it works). I laughed. If it were only that easy! My suspicion was justified. Even after the exercise got wide exposure, my students still failed the challenge to get the extra-credit points. Despite this I remain optimistic. After all, most of my students, about 80 percent, choose two points\u2014just as most people choose to cooperate in real-world situations. Most of us want to do what\u2019s right. But that alone won\u2019t solve our problems, so we need to think creatively and use behavioral science to find solutions. In 2016 I decided to change things up. In hopes of finding a way to increase cooperation, I drew from the scientific literature on social groups and introduced a third option: Students could choose two points, six points\u2014or zero points. That\u2019s right. Zero. Why would anyone do that? Well, for each student who chose zero points, one of the six-point choosers (selected randomly) would lose everything, reducing the total number of six-point choosers by one. Global Footprint Network calculates the date each year when humans\u2019 demand on nature\u2014for food, wood, fiber, and carbon dioxide absorption\u2014exceeds what Earth can regenerate in a year. In 2017 that \u201cEarth Overshoot Day\u201d was the earliest on record\u2014and humans used roughly 1.71 Earths\u2019 worth of resources. 2017: 1.71 EarthsOvershoot Day: August 2 2011: 1.69 EarthsAugust 4 2001: 1.38 EarthsSeptember 22 1991: 1.29 EarthsOctober 10 1981: 1.16 EarthsNovember 11 1971: 1.03 EarthsDecember 20 Source: Global Footprint Network The zero-point option is self-sacrificial; students forgo points for themselves in order to help the group by restraining those who take too much. In behavioral experiments this type of action is called altruistic punishment, a term coined by economists Ernst Fehr and Simon G\u00e4chter. Their research documented people willingly giving up some of their own resources in order to punish those who behave selfishly in a group context\u2014and doing so in the belief that every individual profits from increased cooperation. Usually a few of my students each semester choose the zero-point option, and sometimes that\u2019s all it takes. Just a handful of people can make a huge difference\u2014that is, a few self-sacrificing students can bring down the total number of six-point choosers to below the 10 percent threshold. This additional element has dramatically increased cooperation in my courses. Now roughly half my classes receive the extra-credit points. In my opinion this is a remarkable turnaround. And some of my classes have done this without anyone actually choosing the zero-point option; simply knowing it was available was enough to increase cooperation. Though this type of solution may work on the small scale of a classroom, won\u2019t we need much larger action to curb global problems like climate change? Yes, but the principle is the same\u2013it\u2019s about collective action and reducing overconsumption. For example, recently I started volunteering with Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby (CCL), an organization that advocates for a policy known as carbon fee and dividend. This plan would put a steadily rising fee on fossil fuels and distribute the money raised back to American households (to protect families against rising costs). Ultimately this would reduce fossil fuel consumption by making this type of energy more expensive to use\u2014so reducing consumption would be better for both our wallets and the environment. At CCL, volunteers meet with lawmakers and conduct outreach to the community. Through our efforts\u2014again, collective action\u2014we gain allies in Congress and the public. By early this year the House\u2019s bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus had 70 members (half Democrats and half Republicans) from states across the country. As I write these words, I\u2019m sitting next to my three-month-old daughter, Amelia. Though the planet faces daunting problems, I\u2019m determined to help her have a bright future\u2014so I have to believe that action by even a few people can make a significant difference. A few students can help an entire class of hundreds gain a leg up in the course. A few people who recycle or compost can have a contagious effect on others\u2019 lifestyles. A few politicians\u2019 votes can alter national and international policies that affect millions. The challenge that Garrett Hardin described 50 years ago remains today: Our survival depends on each of us and all of us conserving the commons. I choose to remind myself of that with these wise and hopeful lines from the Beatles: \u201cAll the world is birthday cake / so take a piece / but not too much.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

Considering how my choice affected the rest of the class made me wish that I had chosen two instead.\u201d\n\nModule 10:\nThe class failed the exercise. Actually most people aren\u2019t. But it\u2019s very tricky to get people to cooperate, especially in large groups of complete strangers. After all, if someone else is taking more for themselves (running more water or choosing six points), why shouldn\u2019t I? But if we all think this way, eventually we\u2019ll all lose.\n\nModule 11:\nHardin suggested that education might make a difference\u2014that if we teach people about the consequences of taking too much, they might not. I\u2019ve been skeptical about this idea. When my student\u2019s tweet went viral, some colleagues said that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use the exercise again (because students would already know how it works). I laughed. If it were only that easy! My suspicion was justified. Even after the exercise got wide exposure, my students still failed the challenge to get the extra-credit points.\n\nModule 12:\nDespite this I remain optimistic. After all, most of my students, about 80 percent, choose two points\u2014just as most people choose to cooperate in real-world situations. Most of us want to do what\u2019s right. But that alone won\u2019t solve our problems, so we need to think creatively and use behavioral science to find solutions.\n\nModule 13:\nIn 2016 I decided to change things up. In hopes of finding a way to increase cooperation, I drew from the scientific literature on social groups and introduced a third option: Students could choose two points, six points\u2014or zero points. That\u2019s right. Zero. Why would anyone do that? Well, for each student who chose zero points, one of the six-point choosers (selected randomly) would lose everything, reducing the total number of six-point choosers by one.\n\nModule 14:\nGlobal Footprint Network calculates the date each year when humans\u2019 demand on nature\u2014for food, wood, fiber, and carbon dioxide absorption\u2014exceeds what Earth can regenerate in a year. In 2017 that \u201cEarth Overshoot Day\u201d was the earliest on record\u2014and humans used roughly 1.71 Earths\u2019 worth of resources.\n\nModule 15:\nThe zero-point option is self-sacrificial; students forgo points for themselves in order to help the group by restraining those who take too much. In behavioral experiments this type of action is called altruistic punishment, a term coined by economists Ernst Fehr and Simon G\u00e4chter. Their research documented people willingly giving up some of their own resources in order to punish those who behave selfishly in a group context\u2014and doing so in the belief that every individual profits from increased cooperation.\n\nModule 16:\nUsually a few of my students each semester choose the zero-point option, and sometimes that\u2019s all it takes. Just a handful of people can make a huge difference\u2014that is, a few self-sacrificing students can bring down the total number of six-point choosers to below the 10 percent threshold. This additional element has dramatically increased cooperation in my courses. Now roughly half my classes receive the extra-credit points. In my opinion this is a remarkable turnaround.\n\nModule 17:\nThough this type of solution may work on the small scale of a classroom, won\u2019t we need much larger action to curb global problems like climate change? Yes, but the principle is the same\u2013it\u2019s about collective action and reducing overconsumption. For example, recently I started volunteering with Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby (CCL), an organization that advocates for a policy known as carbon fee and dividend.\n\nModule 18:\nThis plan would put a steadily rising fee on fossil fuels and distribute the money raised back to American households (to protect families against rising costs). Ultimately this would reduce fossil fuel consumption by making this type of energy more expensive to use\u2014so reducing consumption would be better for both our wallets and the environment. At CCL, volunteers meet with lawmakers and conduct outreach to the community. Through our efforts\u2014again, collective action\u2014we gain allies in Congress and the public.\n\nModule 19:\nBy early this year the House\u2019s bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus had 70 members (half Democrats and half Republicans) from states across the country. As I write these words, I\u2019m sitting next to my three-month-old daughter, Amelia. Though the planet faces daunting problems, I\u2019m determined to help her have a bright future\u2014so I have to believe that action by even a few people can make a significant difference.\n\nModule 20:\nA few students can help an entire class of hundreds gain a leg up in the course. A few people who recycle or compost can have a contagious effect on others\u2019 lifestyles. A few politicians\u2019 votes can alter national and international policies that affect millions. The challenge that Garrett Hardin described 50 years ago remains today: Our survival depends on each of us and all of us conserving the commons. I choose to remind myself of that with these wise and hopeful lines from the Beatles: \u201cAll the world is birthday cake / so take a piece / but not too much.\u201d",
        "check": "No",
        "onlytext": "I teach undergraduate psychology courses at the University of Maryland, and my classes draw students with diverse interests. But every one of them perks up when I pose this question: Do you want two extra-credit points on your term paper, or six points? I tell my students that the extra-credit offer is part of an exercise illustrating the interconnectedness of choices individuals make in communities. I explain that the exercise was inspired by an ecologist named Garrett Hardin and an address that he delivered 50 years ago this summer, describing what he called \u201cthe tragedy of the commons.\u201d Hardin said that when many individuals act in their own self-interest without regard for society, the effects can be catastrophic. Hardin used the 19th-century convention of \u201cthe commons\u201d\u2014a cattle-grazing pasture that villagers shared\u2014to warn against the overexploitation of communal resources.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that my students will grasp the connections between the classroom exercise, Hardin\u2019s ideas, and our planet\u2019s most pressing problems (including climate change). I allow them to choose between two points or six points of extra credit\u2014but there\u2019s a catch. I stipulate that if more than 10 percent of the class members choose six points, no one gets any points. The extra-credit points are analogous to water, fuel, grazing pasture (from Hardin\u2019s analysis), or any natural resource. According to some free market economic theories, if everyone strives for maximum personal benefit, then societies will thrive. By this logic the student\u2019s rational choice would be to pick six points, just as the shepherd\u2019s rational choice would be to use as much grazing pasture as possible. And those who maximize personal consumption aren\u2019t greedy\u2014they\u2019re strategic. But when everyone chooses this path, the common resource is overtaxed, and societies end up with overharvesting, water shortages, or climate change.\n\nA possible solution seems simple: If everyone just moderated their consumption, we\u2019d have sustainability. As many of my students say, \u201cIf everyone chooses two points, we\u2019ll all get the points.\u201d And yet, for the first eight years I used this exercise, only one class\u2014of the dozens I taught\u2014stayed under the 10 percent threshold. All the other classes failed. This exercise was developed more than 25 years ago. Professor Steve Drigotas of Johns Hopkins University had been using it for some time when he administered it to me and my classmates in 2005. My class failed too\u2014and I, who had chosen two points, was incredibly frustrated with my peers who had chosen six.\n\nIn 2015 one of my students tweeted about the exercise\u2014\u201cWHAT KIND OF PROFESSOR DOES THIS\u201d\u2014and his lament went viral. People around the globe weighed in: Does so many people choosing six points mean it\u2019s human nature to be greedy and selfish?\n\nDylan Selterman teaches students about the tragedy of the commons with this extra-credit exercise: Choose zero, two, or six points to be added to your final paper grade. If more than 10 percent of you choose six points, no one will receive any points. If you choose zero points, you cancel out one of the six-point choosers, who will receive no points.\n\nZERO POINTS Devin Porter, 21, sociology major \u201cI took the class to get something out of it, not necessarily for the grade. When we didn\u2019t get the extra credit, I felt bad for the people who really needed it, but I wasn\u2019t too surprised. People who chose two made the obvious choice\u2014everyone eats. People who chose six thought they could get away with it.\u201d\n\nTWO POINTSRobin Bachkosky, 19, nursing major\u200a\u201cI thought I made a pretty beneficial choice for the class and myself, one that wouldn\u2019t necessarily put the class to any disadvantage but would give me some extra credit.

        "text": "Premium Content Precious items of the Yupik people, long frozen in time, are emerging as temperatures rise. Now the rush is on to save them. The archaeological site of Nunalleq on the southwest coast of Alaska preserves a fateful moment, frozen in time. The muddy square of earth is full of everyday things that the indigenous Yupik people used to survive and to celebrate life here, all left just as they lay when a deadly attack came almost four centuries ago. Around the perimeter of what was once a large sod structure are traces of fire used to smoke out the residents\u2014some 50 people, probably an alliance of extended families, who lived here when they weren\u2019t out hunting, fishing, and gathering plants. No one, it seems, was spared. Archaeologists unearthed the remains of someone, likely a woman, who appears to have succumbed to smoke inhalation as she tried to dig an escape tunnel under a wall. Skeletons of women, children, and elders were found together, facedown in the mud, suggesting that they were captured and killed. As is often the case in archaeology, a tragedy of long ago is a boon to modern science. Archaeologists have recovered more than 2,500 intact artifacts at Nunalleq, from typical eating utensils to extraordinary things such as wooden ritual masks, ivory tattoo needles, and a belt of caribou teeth. Beyond the sheer quantity and variety, the objects are astonishingly well preserved, having been frozen in the ground since about 1660. Emma Frances Echuck and her daughter Valerie take a break from drying salmon in the village of Quinhagak. At a nearby archaeological site artifacts such as this mask are emerging from the permafrost as it thaws. The remains of baskets and mats still retain the intricate twists of their woven patterns. Break open a muddy, fibrous bundle and you\u2019ll find crisp, green blades of grass preserved inside. \u201cThis grass was cut when Shakespeare walked the Earth,\u201d marvels lead archaeologist Rick Knecht, a quiet, grizzled veteran of decades of digging. Knecht, who\u2019s based at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, sees a link between the destruction at the site and the old tales that modern Yupiks remember. Oral tradition preserves memories of a time historians call the Bow and Arrow Wars, when Yupik communities fought each other in bloody battles sometime before Russian explorers arrived in Alaska in the 1700s. Nunalleq offers the first archaeological evidence, and the first firm date, for this frightful period, which affected several generations of Yupiks. Knecht believes the attacks were the result of climate change\u2014a 550-year chilling of the Earth now known as the Little Ice Age\u2014that coincided with Nunalleq\u2019s occupation. The coldest years in Alaska, in the 1600s, must have been a desperate time, with raids probably launched to steal food. \u201cWhenever you get rapid change, there\u2019s a lot of disruption in the seasonal cycles of subsistence,\u201d Knecht says. \u201cIf you get an extreme, like a Little Ice Age\u2014or like now\u2014changes can occur faster than people can adjust.\u201d   Today increasingly violent weather has driven Nunalleq to the brink of oblivion. In summer everything looks fine as the land dons its perennial robe of white-flowering yarrow and sprigs of cotton grass that light up like candles when the morning sun hits the tundra. But the scene turns alarming come winter, when the Bering Sea hurls vicious storms at the coast. If the waves get big enough, they crash across a narrow gravel beach and rip away at the remains of the site. The Arctic wasn\u2019t always like this, but global climate change is now hammering the Earth\u2019s polar regions. The result is a disastrous loss of artifacts from little known prehistoric cultures\u2014like the one at Nunalleq\u2014all along Alaska\u2019s shores and beyond. \u00d6tzi, the Stone Age man whose body was found in 1991 as it emerged from a receding Italian glacier, is the most famous example of ancient remains brought to light by warmer weather. But a massive thaw is exposing traces of past peoples and civilizations across the northern regions of the globe\u2014from Neolithic bows and arrows in Switzerland to hiking staffs from the Viking age in Norway and lavishly appointed tombs of Scythian nomads in Siberia. So many sites are in danger that archaeologists are beginning to specialize in the rescue of once frozen artifacts. They\u2019re having to make hard choices, though. Which few things can they afford to rescue? And which will they just have to let go? In coastal Alaska, archaeological sites are now threatened by a one-two punch. The first blow: average temperatures that have risen more than three degrees Fahrenheit in the past half century. As one balmy day follows another, the permafrost is thawing almost everywhere. When archaeologists began digging at Nunalleq in 2009, they hit frozen soil about 18 inches below the surface of the tundra. Today the ground is thawed three feet down. That means masterfully carved artifacts of caribou antler, driftwood, bone, and walrus ivory are emerging from the deep freeze that has preserved them in perfect condition. If they\u2019re not rescued, they immediately begin to rot and crumble. The knockout blow: rising seas. The global level of oceans has risen about eight inches since 1900. That\u2019s a direct threat to coastal sites such as Nunalleq, which is doubly vulnerable to wave damage now that the thawing permafrost is making the land sink. \u201cOne good winter storm and we could lose this whole site,\u201d Knecht says. He speaks from experience. Since the start of the excavation, the relentless action of the sea has torn about 35 feet from the edge of the site. The winter after the 2010 dig was particularly brutal. Residents of Quinhagak, the modern village just four miles up the beach, remember huge chunks of ice slamming into the coast. By the time Knecht and his crew returned, the entire area they had excavated was gone. Since then Knecht has pressed on with a renewed sense of urgency. Rain or shine, during the six-week dig season, about two dozen archaeologists and student volunteers spend long summer days on their hands and knees gently stripping away soil with their trowels. When this wooden paddle blade from Nunalleq was new, people relied on kayaks to get around. Modern Yupiks use motorboats to visit other villages, hunt sea mammals, and net fish. Mike Smith (right) waded into the Kanektok River before work to hook a few salmon, which he gave to his grandmother. \u201cShe was so happy, she put on her apron right away and began cutting them up,\u201d\nhe says. On an August day that begins warm and buggy but soon turns overcast and cold, Tricia Gillam finds a common artifact that was created with exceptional artistry. It\u2019s a women\u2019s cutting tool popularly called an ulu\u2014uluaq in Yupik\u2014with a curved blade of slate and a carved wooden handle. The archaeologists often uncover a blade, a handle, or an occasional complete ulu, yet this one brings gasps from everyone. The handle has the graceful shape of a seal. But that\u2019s only half the design, it turns out. When local carver John Smith takes a look later from another angle, he sees the outline of a whale. The artifact speaks to the fundamental Yupik worldview that nothing is a single, inflexible entity because everything is in a state of transformation. The ulu handle is a seal, but it\u2019s not a seal. It\u2019s a whale, but it\u2019s not a whale. Other finds embody that same idea: A mask that\u2019s a walrus, or a person. A small wooden box that\u2019s a kayak, or a seal. \u201cThat dynamism is a constant part of their lives,\u201d Knecht says. \u201cAnd climate change is part of that.\u201d If anyone\u2019s going to survive the changes occurring in the natural world, he believes, it\u2019s these people who have always seen their environment as something fluid, requiring adjustments and adaptations. They know firsthand the seasonal patterns of plants and animals, and if there\u2019s a shift, they\u2019ll shift with it.   On a visit to 86-year-old Carrie Pleasant (right), Sarah Brown gets advice on sewing a beaver-skin parka. Pleasant made fur garments for all 10 of her children, but kids today usually wear store-bought clothing. \u201cThings are changing so much,\u201d she said wistfully. Pleasant has since passed away.   The village of Quinhagak sits on Yupik land at the mouth of the Kanektok River, which winds across the tundra in wide loops before spilling into the Bering Sea. A few gravel streets run past a school, church, post office, supermarket, hardware store, health clinic, gas station, washateria, cell phone tower, and three sleek wind turbines that spin in the brisk sea breeze. Officially, 745 people live here, in metal-roofed, wood-frame houses that perch on stilts a foot or so above the once frozen ground. But on any given day the actual population may be larger, swelled by relatives who have come to stay for several weeks, and residents of nearby villages who have come to shop, visit friends, and maybe pull in a few fish. Based in an office building that also serves as the archaeologists\u2019 headquarters, 50-year-old Warren Jones is president of the local Yupik corporation known as Qanirtuuq, Inc., managing its 130,564 acres, overseeing its businesses and financial assets, and negotiating contracts with the outside world. But he\u2019d really rather be hunting, he tells me. Along with almost everyone else here, he follows the same cycles of subsistence as the generations of Yupiks who came before him. \u201cMost of our diet is from the stuff we gather, hunt, or fish,\u201d he says. \u201cMy grandpa used to say, if you don\u2019t have wood, fish stored away, berries, birds, you might as well be dead, because you don\u2019t have nothing.\u201d From a traditional lookout, hunters scan the tundra for moose. Land and sea are like supermarkets for the Yupik, who know exactly what foods to search for in each season of the year. Locals\u2019 ancestors carved the life-size mask above. Part human and part walrus, it was worn in a ritual dance to ensure a safe, successful hunt. \u201cEven now, with rifles, going after a walrus is scary,\u201d says Knecht. Early August, when the excavation is in full swing, is a busy season for the villagers as they tap nature\u2019s larder. Berries are ripening across the tundra, and fat coho salmon, known here as silvers, are swimming up the Kanektok on their way to spawn. In keeping with Yupik tradition, Misty Matthew helps her mother, Grace Anaver, gather food for the winter. On the days she goes berry picking, Matthew drives an ATV deep into a flat, green landscape dotted with others on the same mission, hunched over as they fill their plastic buckets. Salmonberries ripen first, one small, sweet, orange cloud per plant. Then blueberries, with a vivid, sweet-tart flavor that no supermarket fruit can match, and low-growing black crowberries that are crunchy and subtly sweet. No one here thinks in pints. It\u2019s gallons they need. Matthew stirs up some of her haul with sugar and fluffy shortening to make a snack called akutaq, or Eskimo ice cream. Then she makes jam in her grandmother\u2019s old stainless steel pot, and jelly with the leftover juice. But the bulk of the picking goes into big chest freezers in a backyard shed. She opens all three to show me what her mother already has gathered. One is stuffed with berries in clear plastic bags. Another has berries, salmon, seal oil, trout, and smelt. The last holds moose, clams, geese, swans, caribou, and two kinds of wild greens. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be fat in this village. It means you\u2019re eating well,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have three years of food stored away to get you through the lean times.\u201d On another day, early in the morning, Matthew and her brother, David, take out their family\u2019s motorboat to net salmon on the river. An hour later they bring 40 silvers, easily 20 pounds each, to the wooden drying racks along a quiet side creek where their mother is waiting. The two women spend the rest of the day gutting the fish, cutting fillets, and slicing strips for brining, drying, and smoking\u2014everything done with deft strokes of their ulus. Like many people who grew up here, Matthew has sometimes left Quinhagak to find work, but the people, the tundra, and the river keep pulling her back. Yet even after years away, she can see that the natural rhythms of life are out of whack. \u201cEverything\u2019s two or three weeks ahead now,\u201d she says as she cuts into a fish. \u201cThe salmon are late. And the geese are flying early. The berries were early too.\u201d If there\u2019s one thing everyone in Quinhagak agrees on, and talks about often, it\u2019s all the changes brought by the weird weather. \u201cTwenty years ago the elders began to say the ground was sinking,\u201d says Warren Jones, as we chat in his office. \u201cThe past 10 years or so it\u2019s been so bad everybody\u2019s noticed. We\u2019re boating in February. That\u2019s supposed to be the coldest month of the year.\u201d The strangest thing? Three successive winters without snow. On his computer, he pulls up a YouTube video made by a teacher at the village school. As the song \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d plays in the background, fourth graders try to ski, sled, and make snow angels on bare ground, in December. Even without warmer winters, the children\u2019s lives are very different from what their elders experienced. Qanirtuuq chairperson Grace Hill, 66, sees trends that concern her\u2014like the fading language. \u201cWhen I went to first grade, I only spoke Yupik. Now the kids only speak English,\u201d she tells me in the fluent, slightly accented English that she learned in school. And then, of course, there\u2019s the modern technology that\u2019s changing everything everywhere. \u201cThe kids are more into computers\u2014and they\u2019re forgetting about our culture,\u201d she worries. Like other older villagers, Hill at first opposed the excavation of Nunalleq because Yupik tradition says ancestors shouldn\u2019t be disturbed. But now she believes that archaeology can serve a greater good. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this will get the kids interested in their past,\u201d she says. Henry Small has the same thing in mind one sunny afternoon when he brings his 11-year-old daughter, Alqaq, to Nunalleq to check out the progress of the dig. This is their second visit this summer. When I ask him what he hopes his daughter learns here, he responds as if the answer were obvious: \u201cWhere she comes from!\u201d Alqaq, in a pink T-shirt, plaid capris, and movie-star sunglasses, is getting the message. On previous visits she has helped sort artifacts and sift the excavated soil for small things the archaeologists might have overlooked. She especially likes the dolls, she says, and the lip plugs. And what about the ulus, like the one her father made for her birthday, with her name carved into the handle? \u201cIt\u2019s cool that we get to use what our ancestors were using,\u201d she says without hesitation. Today\u2019s visit is brief, with no work to do, so Alqaq and her father soon head up the beach toward home on an ATV. Archaeology\u2019s potential to inspire such appreciation for the past is what motivated Jones to get the dig started. He asked Knecht to assess the eroding site, then helped convince the village\u2019s board of directors that excavating Nunalleq was a good idea. He also got the board to fund the first two years of digging and provide ongoing logistical support. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t cheap,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to get the artifacts for our future generations, money didn\u2019t matter.\u201d At the end of each field season the archaeologists have packed up what they\u2019ve found and shipped it to the University of Aberdeen for conservation. But all the artifacts will be sent back later this year, destined for an old school building that Quinhagak has converted to a heritage center. Jones envisions this as a place where people can see, touch, and share stories about the beautifully worked possessions of their ancestors. \u201cI want our kids who are in college now to run it and be proud that it\u2019s ours,\u201d he says. And when this dream takes shape and the center opens its doors? \u201cI want to be the first to go in and say, \u2018I\u2019m Yupik, and this is where I come from.\u2019 \u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "Modularized": "Here is the modularized article:\n\nModule 1:\nThe archaeological site of Nunalleq on the southwest coast of Alaska preserves a fateful moment, frozen in time. The muddy square of earth is full of everyday things that the indigenous Yupik people used to survive and to celebrate life here, all left just as they lay when a deadly attack came almost four centuries ago. Around the perimeter of what was once a large sod structure are traces of fire used to smoke out the residents\u2014some 50 people, probably an alliance of extended families, who lived here when they weren\u2019t out hunting, fishing, and gathering plants.\n\nModule 2:\nAs is often the case in archaeology, a tragedy of long ago is a boon to modern science. Archaeologists have recovered more than 2,500 intact artifacts at Nunalleq, from typical eating utensils to extraordinary things such as wooden ritual masks, ivory tattoo needles, and a belt of caribou teeth. Beyond the sheer quantity and variety, the objects are astonishingly well preserved, having been frozen in the ground since about 1660. Emma Frances Echuck and her daughter Valerie take a break from drying salmon in the village of Quinhagak. At a nearby archaeological site artifacts such as this mask are emerging from the permafrost as it thaws.\n\nModule 3:\nLead archaeologist Rick Knecht, a quiet, grizzled veteran of decades of digging, sees a link between the destruction at the site and the old tales that modern Yupiks remember. Oral tradition preserves memories of a time historians call the Bow and Arrow Wars, when Yupik communities fought each other in bloody battles sometime before Russian explorers arrived in Alaska in the 1700s. Nunalleq offers the first archaeological evidence, and the first firm date, for this frightful period, which affected several generations of Yupiks. Knecht believes the attacks were the result of climate change\u2014a 550-year chilling of the Earth now known as the Little Ice Age\u2014that coincided with Nunalleq\u2019s occupation.\n\nModule 4:\nToday increasingly violent weather has driven Nunalleq to the brink of oblivion. In summer everything looks fine as the land dons its perennial robe of white-flowering yarrow and sprigs of cotton grass that light up like candles when the morning sun hits the tundra. But the scene turns alarming come winter, when the Bering Sea hurls vicious storms at the coast. If the waves get big enough, they crash across a narrow gravel beach and rip away at the remains of the site. The Arctic wasn\u2019t always like this, but global climate change is now hammering the Earth\u2019s polar regions.\n\nModule 5:\nThe result is a disastrous loss of artifacts from little known prehistoric cultures\u2014like the one at Nunalleq\u2014all along Alaska\u2019s shores and beyond. \u00d6tzi, the Stone Age man whose body was found in 1991 as it emerged from a receding Italian glacier, is the most famous example of ancient remains brought to light by warmer weather. But a massive thaw is exposing traces of past peoples and civilizations across the northern regions of the globe\u2014from Neolithic bows and arrows in Switzerland to hiking staffs from the Viking age in Norway and lavishly appointed tombs of Scythian nomads in Siberia.\n\nModule 6:\nSo many sites are in danger that archaeologists are beginning to specialize in the rescue of once frozen artifacts. They\u2019re having to make hard choices, though. Which few things can they afford to rescue? And which will they just have to let go? In coastal Alaska, archaeological sites are now threatened by a one-two punch. The first blow: average temperatures that have risen more than three degrees Fahrenheit in the past half century. As one balmy day follows another, the permafrost is thawing almost everywhere.\n\nModule 7:\nThe knockout blow: rising seas. The global level of oceans has risen about eight inches since 1900. That\u2019s a direct threat to coastal sites such as Nunalleq, which is doubly vulnerable to wave damage now that the thawing permafrost is making the land sink. \u201cOne good winter storm and we could lose this whole site,\u201d Knecht says. He speaks from experience. Since the start of the excavation, the relentless action of the sea has torn about 35 feet from the edge of the site.\n\nModule 8:\nRain or shine, during the six-week dig season, about two dozen archaeologists and student volunteers spend long summer days on their hands and knees gently stripping away soil with their trowels. When this wooden paddle blade from Nunalleq was new, people relied on kayaks to get around. Modern Yupiks use motorboats to visit other villages, hunt sea mammals, and net fish. Mike Smith (right) waded into the Kanektok River before work to hook a few salmon, which he gave to his grandmother.\n\nModule 9:\nOn an August day that begins warm and buggy but soon turns overcast and cold, Tricia Gillam finds a common artifact that was created with exceptional artistry. It\u2019s a women\u2019s cutting tool popularly called an ulu\u2014uluaq in Yupik\u2014with a curved blade of slate and a carved wooden handle. The archaeologists often uncover a blade, a handle, or an occasional complete ulu, yet this one brings gasps from everyone. The handle has the graceful shape of a seal. But that\u2019s only half the design, it turns out. When local carver John Smith takes a look later from another angle, he sees the outline of a whale.\n\nModule 10:\nThe artifact speaks to the fundamental Yupik worldview that nothing is a single, inflexible entity because everything is in a state of transformation. The ulu handle is a seal, but it\u2019s not a seal. It\u2019s a whale, but it\u2019s not a whale. Other finds embody that same idea: A mask that\u2019s a walrus, or a person. A small wooden box that\u2019s a kayak, or a seal. \u201cThat dynamism is a constant part of their lives,\u201d Knecht says. \u201cAnd climate change is part of that.\u201d\n\nModule 11:\nIf anyone\u2019s going to survive the changes occurring in the natural world, he believes, it\u2019s these people who have always seen their environment as something fluid, requiring adjustments and adaptations. They know firsthand the seasonal patterns of plants and animals, and if there\u2019s a shift, they\u2019ll shift with it. On a visit to 86-year-old Carrie Pleasant (right), Sarah Brown gets advice on sewing a beaver-skin parka. Pleasant made fur garments for all 10 of her children, but kids today usually wear store-bought clothing.\n\nModule 12:\nThe village of Quinhagak sits on Yupik land at the mouth of the Kanektok River, which winds across the tundra in wide loops before spilling into the Bering Sea. A few gravel streets run past a school, church, post office, supermarket, hardware store, health clinic, gas station, washateria, cell phone tower, and three sleek wind turbines that spin in the brisk sea breeze. Officially, 745 people live here, in metal-roofed, wood-frame houses that perch on stilts a foot or so above the once frozen ground.\n\nModule 13:\nBut on any given day the actual population may be larger, swelled by relatives who have come to stay for several weeks, and residents of nearby villages who have come to shop, visit friends, and maybe pull in a few fish. Based in an office building that also serves as the archaeologists\u2019 headquarters, 50-year-old Warren Jones is president of the local Yupik corporation known as Qanirtuuq, Inc., managing its 130,564 acres, overseeing its businesses and financial assets, and negotiating contracts with the outside world.\n\nModule 14:\nAlong with almost everyone else here, he follows the same cycles of subsistence as the generations of Yupiks who came before him. \u201cMost of our diet is from the stuff we gather, hunt, or fish,\u201d he says. \u201cMy grandpa used to say, if you don\u2019t have wood, fish stored away, berries, birds, you might as well be dead, because you don\u2019t have nothing.\u201d From a traditional lookout, hunters scan the tundra for moose. Land and sea are like supermarkets for the Yupik, who know exactly what foods to search for in each season of the year.\n\nModule 15:\nEarly August, when the excavation is in full swing, is a busy season for the villagers as they tap nature\u2019s larder. Berries are ripening across the tundra, and fat coho salmon, known here as silvers, are swimming up the Kanektok on their way to spawn. In keeping with Yupik tradition, Misty Matthew helps her mother, Grace Anaver, gather food for the winter. On the days she goes berry picking, Matthew drives an ATV deep into a flat, green landscape dotted with others on the same mission, hunched over as they fill their plastic buckets.\n\nModule 16:\nSalmonberries ripen first, one small, sweet, orange cloud per plant. Then blueberries, with a vivid, sweet-tart flavor that no supermarket fruit can match, and low-growing black crowberries that are crunchy and subtly sweet. No one here thinks in pints. It\u2019s gallons they need. Matthew stirs up some of her haul with sugar and fluffy shortening to make a snack called akutaq, or Eskimo ice cream. Then she makes jam in her grandmother\u2019s old stainless steel pot, and jelly with the leftover juice.\n\nModule 17:\nBut the bulk of the picking goes into big chest freezers in a backyard shed. She opens all three to show me what her mother already has gathered. One is stuffed with berries in clear plastic bags. Another has berries, salmon, seal oil, trout, and smelt. The last holds moose, clams, geese, swans, caribou, and two kinds of wild greens. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be fat in this village. It means you\u2019re eating well,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have three years of food stored away to get you through the lean times.\u201d\n\nModule 18:\nOn another day, early in the morning, Matthew and her brother, David, take out their family\u2019s motorboat to net salmon on the river. An hour later they bring 40 silvers, easily 20 pounds each, to the wooden drying racks along a quiet side creek where their mother is waiting. The two women spend the rest of the day gutting the fish, cutting fillets, and slicing strips for brining, drying, and smoking\u2014everything done with deft strokes of their ulus.\n\nModule 19:\nLike many people who grew up here, Matthew has sometimes left Quinhagak to find work, but the people, the tundra, and the river keep pulling her back. Yet even after years away, she can see that the natural rhythms of life are out of whack. \u201cEverything\u2019s two or three weeks ahead now,\u201d she says as she cuts into a fish. \u201cThe salmon are late. And the geese are flying early. The berries were early too.\u201d\n\nModule 20:\nIf there\u2019s one thing everyone in Quinhagak agrees on, and talks about often, it\u2019s all the changes brought by the weird weather. \u201cTwenty years ago the elders began to say the ground was sinking,\u201d says Warren Jones, as we chat in his office. \u201cThe past 10 years or so it\u2019s been so bad everybody\u2019s noticed. We\u2019re boating in February. That\u2019s supposed to be the coldest month of the year.\u201d\n\nModule 21:\nThe strangest thing? Three successive winters without snow. On his computer, he pulls up a YouTube video made by a teacher at the village school. As the song \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d plays in the background, fourth graders try to ski, sled, and make snow angels on bare ground, in December.\n\nModule 22:\nEven without warmer winters, the children\u2019s lives are very different from what their elders experienced. Qanirtuuq chairperson Grace Hill, 66, sees trends that concern her\u2014like the fading language. \u201cWhen I went to first grade, I only spoke Yupik. Now the kids only speak English,\u201d she tells me in the fluent, slightly accented English that she learned in school. And then, of course, there\u2019s the modern technology that\u2019s changing everything everywhere.\n\nModule 23:\nLike other older villagers, Hill at first opposed the excavation of Nunalleq because Yupik tradition says ancestors shouldn\u2019t be disturbed. But now she believes that archaeology can serve a greater good. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this will get the kids interested in their past,\u201d she says. Henry Small has the same thing in mind one sunny afternoon when he brings his 11-year-old daughter, Alqaq, to Nunalleq to check out the progress of the dig.\n\nModule 24:\nThis is their second visit this summer. When I ask him what he hopes his daughter learns here, he responds as if the answer were obvious: \u201cWhere she comes from!\u201d Alqaq, in a pink T-shirt, plaid capris, and movie-star sunglasses, is getting the message. On previous visits she has helped sort artifacts and sift the excavated soil for small things the archaeologists might have overlooked. She especially likes the dolls, she says, and the lip plugs.",

No one, it seems, was spared. Archaeologists unearthed the remains of someone, likely a woman, who appears to have succumbed to smoke inhalation as she tried to dig an escape tunnel under a wall. Skeletons of women, children, and elders were found together, facedown in the mud, suggesting that they were captured and killed.\n\nAs is often the case in archaeology, a tragedy of long ago is a boon to modern science. Archaeologists have recovered more than 2,500 intact artifacts at Nunalleq, from typical eating utensils to extraordinary things such as wooden ritual masks, ivory tattoo needles, and a belt of caribou teeth.

At a nearby archaeological site artifacts such as this mask are emerging from the permafrost as it thaws. The remains of baskets and mats still retain the intricate twists of their woven patterns. Break open a muddy, fibrous bundle and you\u2019ll find crisp, green blades of grass preserved inside. \u201cThis grass was cut when Shakespeare walked the Earth,\u201d marvels lead archaeologist Rick Knecht, a quiet, grizzled veteran of decades of digging.\n\nKnecht, who\u2019s based at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, sees a link between the destruction at the site and the old tales that modern Yupiks remember.

The coldest years in Alaska, in the 1600s, must have been a desperate time, with raids probably launched to steal food. \u201cWhenever you get rapid change, there\u2019s a lot of disruption in the seasonal cycles of subsistence,\u201d Knecht says. \u201cIf you get an extreme, like a Little Ice Age\u2014or like now\u2014changes can occur faster than people can adjust.\u201d\n\nToday increasingly violent weather has driven Nunalleq to the brink of oblivion.

The first blow: average temperatures that have risen more than three degrees Fahrenheit in the past half century. As one balmy day follows another, the permafrost is thawing almost everywhere. When archaeologists began digging at Nunalleq in 2009, they hit frozen soil about 18 inches below the surface of the tundra. Today the ground is thawed three feet down. That means masterfully carved artifacts of caribou antler, driftwood, bone, and walrus ivory are emerging from the deep freeze that has preserved them in perfect condition. If they\u2019re not rescued, they immediately begin to rot and crumble.\n\nThe knockout blow: rising seas. The global level of oceans has risen about eight inches since 1900. That\u2019s a direct threat to coastal sites such as Nunalleq, which is doubly vulnerable to wave damage now that the thawing permafrost is making the land sink. \u201cOne good winter storm and we could lose this whole site,\u201d Knecht says. He speaks from experience. Since the start of the excavation, the relentless action of the sea has torn about 35 feet from the edge of the site.\n\nThe winter after the 2010 dig was particularly brutal. Residents of Quinhagak, the modern village just four miles up the beach, remember huge chunks of ice slamming into the coast. By the time Knecht and his crew returned, the entire area they had excavated was gone. Since then Knecht has pressed on with a renewed sense of urgency.\n\nRain or shine, during the six-week dig season, about two dozen archaeologists and student volunteers spend long summer days on their hands and knees gently stripping away soil with their trowels.

And what about the ulus, like the one her father made for her birthday, with her name carved into the handle? \u201cIt\u2019s cool that we get to use what our ancestors were using,\u201d she says without hesitation.\n\nToday\u2019s visit is brief, with no work to do, so Alqaq and her father soon head up the beach toward home on an ATV. Archaeology\u2019s potential to inspire such appreciation for the past is what motivated Jones to get the dig started. He asked Knecht to assess the eroding site, then helped convince the village\u2019s board of directors that excavating Nunalleq was a good idea. He also got the board to fund the first two years of digging and provide ongoing logistical support. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t cheap,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to get the artifacts for our future generations, money didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nAt the end of each field season the archaeologists have packed up what they\u2019ve found and shipped it to the University of Aberdeen for conservation. But all the artifacts will be sent back later this year, destined for an old school building that Quinhagak has converted to a heritage center. Jones envisions this as a place where people can see, touch, and share stories about the beautifully worked possessions of their ancestors. \u201cI want our kids who are in college now to run it and be proud that it\u2019s ours,\u201d he says. And when this dream takes shape and the center opens its doors? \u201cI want to be the first to go in and say, \u2018I\u2019m Yupik, and this is where I come from.\u2019 \u201d"

        "title": "Are migraines getting worse?",
        "text": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Migraines are increasing in frequency and intensity among Americans: Could climate change be a reason? Although the number of Americans who have migraines has remained stable for the last 30 years, their impact on people\u2019s daily activities \u2014 including missing social events or being less productive at school or work \u2014 has become much worse, according to a recent study. The report, published in early May in the journal Headache, analyzed 11 studies among U.S. adults from 1989 to 2018 on both episodic and chronic migraines. Researchers found the prevalence of migraines in the past three decades has remained stable, but found Migraine Disability Assessment Scale scores, which measure how migraines affect a person\u2019 daily activities, jumped from 22.0% to 42.4% since 2004, the study found. The \u201cdisability\u201d scores reflect how severe a migraine is.\u00a0 Migraines affect an estimated 39 million adults in the U.S, according to the American Migraine Foundation. \u201cWhile the burden initially increased more significantly among women and has since stabilized, the rate of burden in men has continued to escalate,\u201d lead author Dr. Fred Cohen, assistant professor of medicine and neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told NBC News.\u00a0 \u201cAdditionally, our research indicates that the average monthly frequency of headaches has risen over the past 20 years.\u201d Dr. Timothy A. Collins, chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, said migraines are causing people to be less productive at school and work, attend fewer social and leisure activities and perform fewer household chores because the migraines more frequent and more forceful. Collins was not part of the study. The Mount Sinai researchers note that the observed increase in the frequency and negative impact of migraines on work and home productivity may be due to increased social awareness of migraines and less stigma around the debilitating condition.\u00a0Another factor could be environmental changes such as climate change. Erratic and severe weather conditions are known triggers for migraines, Cohen said. \u201cAs extreme weather events, like hurricanes, become more frequent and intense, they could be contributing to an increase in migraine attacks and their severity,\u201d he said. There is some evidence that thunderstorms and barometric pressure can trigger headaches, but it\u2019s unclear if \u201cregular\u201d air pollution \u2014 such as bad air from wildfires \u2014 is a migraine trigger, Collins added. These weather changes may trigger a migraine by disrupting the balance of chemicals in the brain, like serotonin, according to the Mayo Clinic. Weather-related triggers include bright sunlight, extreme heat or cold, sun glare and high humidity.\u00a0 British researchers warned Wednesday that extreme weather and heat fluctuations may aggravate neurological disorders such as stroke, dementia and schizophrenia. Climate change could also be linked to migraine \"severity, duration and frequency,\" according to the paper, published Wednesday in the Lancet Neurology. \"Worsening climate conditions (including rising temperatures, extreme weather patterns, and escalating pollution) are likely to lead to effects of two types: heightened attack frequency in people who already have migraine, and an upsurge in the overall occurrence of migraine,\" the scientists from University College London wrote. Monitoring weather changes, such as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s HeatRisk tool or your local National Weather Service Forecast Office, can help migraine patients who are sensitive to extreme weather. Dr. Mark Burish, director of the Will Erwin Headache Research Center at UTHealth Houston, said the research highlights a \u201cconcerning trend,\u201d but why migraine disability is worsening is still unclear.\u00a0 Dr. Rochelle Frank, a clinical professor in neurology at the University of California Davis School of Medicine, said, \u201cThere are many factors that could\u00a0be contributing\u00a0to these findings.\u201d\u00a0 More research is needed, she said.\u00a0 Treatment for migraines may be based on a patient\u2019s medical history, other medications being prescribed, as well as personal preference, Burish said. One of the main risk factors for increased severity and frequency of migraine attacks is inadequate treatment, Cohen said.\u00a0 \u201cAs-needed\u201d treatments can range from over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen, to prescription medicines and wearable devices, Burish said.\u00a0 \u201cFor patients who have headaches often or are heavily burdened by their headaches despite their \u2018as needed\u2019 treatment, we add a preventive treatment,\u201d Burish said.\u00a0 This may include over-the-counter supplements, prescription medications, self-administered injections, wearable devices, infusions and provider-performed procedures, he said. Preventative medication can often decrease the number of days that people get headaches every month by greater than 50%, Collins added. Not all treatment requires medication. Many people may not realize how everyday conditions \u2014 dehydration, sleep deprivation, skipping meals and emotional stress \u2014\u00a0can trigger symptoms. Dietary changes such as avoiding caffeinated beverages, chocolate or alcohol that can trigger a migraine, improving sleep hygiene and vitamin/mineral supplements can also have a significant impact on headache health, Cohen said. Shiv Sudhakar, M.D., is an infectious disease specialist and health contributor to NBC News Health.

Since the time of the ancient Egyptians, people have marveled at what researchers say is among \"the most charismatic species on our planet,\" but nobody knew where they originated from \u2013 until now.\u00a0 There are currently eight species of the tall and wide-trunked plants, also known as upside-down trees or \"mother of the forest.\" Of these groups, six species are found on Madagascar, one is found across continental Africa and another is found only in northwestern Australia.\u00a0 But only one of those locations is the true origin of them all.\u00a0 Researchers say they solved the mystery of the \"spectacular trees\" using the species' DNA . In a new study published in Nature, they said all the trees came from the African island nation of Madagascar.\u00a0 Baobabs have \"captivated botanists, tourists, naturalists and passers-by for centuries,\" the study says. \"Probably the earliest record of humans marvelling at these amazing trees can be traced back to the Ancient Egyptians, around 2,300 BC. With their grotesque appearance, enormous size, reputed longevity and diverse uses, baobabs have become one of the most charismatic species on our planet.\"\u00a0 Nailing down that charisma was difficult. But researchers say that after picking leaves off the species and analyzing genomes, they were able to determine that their common ancestor was based in Madagascar. Over time, members of the species were radiated off the island, making hybrid species that would evolve to have different flowers that attract various other animals.\u00a0 \"We were delighted to be involved in this project uncovering patterns of baobab speciation in Madagascar followed by the astonishing long-distance dispersal of two species, one to Africa and another to Australia,\" Queen Mary University of London professor Andrew Leitch said. \"This was accompanied by the evolution of some fascinating pollination syndromes involving hawkmoths, lemurs and bats.\" According to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, baobabs are \"like no other.\"\u00a0 \"A thick, bottle-like trunk rises to support spindly branches. Baobabs are deciduous, and during the dry season (which can last up to nine months), the bare branches of a baobab resemble a gnarled root system, and make these trees look as if they were pulled up by the roots and pushed back in upside down,\" the organization says.\u00a0 The alliance says that the trees not only serve a key role in their ecosystems, but create their own. Along with helping soil stay humid, recycle nutrients and prevent erosion, they also provide food, water and shelter to other species.\u00a0 The smallest of the baobab species grows to 16 feet, while the largest of the trees can grow to be about 82 feet tall, with a circumference that measures the same, or even more. For comparison, a semitruck is typically around 72 feet long.\u00a0 But many of these trees are facing a conservation battle. All but one of the species is including the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with three considered to be threatened with extinction, one considered critically endangered and another considered endangered, the study says. Only one species is classified \"least concern,\" although its populations are declining.\u00a0 The DNA findings show that some of the trees have low genetic diversity, a key component of species' survival as it helps establish resilience to environmental changes. Their findings also suggest climate change \"will pose severe threats\" to one of the Madagascar-based species and could force it to go extinct before 2080. Based on this, study researchers say that their findings should be cause for re-evaluation of the conservation status of the baobabs.\u00a0 The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance also noted a \"rapid increase\" in deaths of the trees in southern Africa.\u00a0 \"Of the continent's 13 largest baobabs, 9 have collapsed and died,\" the group said. \"The cause is unclear, but scientists suspect that global climate change may be playing a role in the demise of these trees.\" Li Cohen is a senior social media producer at CBS News.

It's the latest \u2014 and most serious \u2014 example of what for many airline passengers is a merely unpleasant experience: turbulence. The Federal Aviation Administration tracks injuries to airline passengers and crew members due to turbulence during flights. The most recent annual statistics\u00a0published by the agency show that total injuries ranged from five to 18 per year between 2009 and 2019, although double-digit totals were recorded a majority of the time. Injury reports dropped after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the FAA recording five total injuries due to turbulence in 2020 and six total injuries in 2021. Turbulence, which causes planes to suddenly jolt while in flight, is considered a fairly normal occurrence and nothing to fear. The movement is caused by \"atmospheric pressure, jet streams, air around mountains, cold or warm weather fronts, or thunderstorms,\" according to\u00a0the FAA. \"Severe weather increases chances of turbulence, and due to climate change, these kinds of incidents will only continue to grow,\" Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, told CBS News in 2022. Garland said that the instances of turbulence that led to injuries that summer may have been weather related.\u00a0 \"The summer months are normally very weather prone, with thunderstorms, and so aviation is affected by weather,\" she said. \"So while it's typical, most turbulence is not something to be concerned about.\" Climate change is affecting air travel in a few ways: extreme heat can make it harder for airplanes to take off, flooding from storm surges and sea level rise is a greater risk for airports and the risk of mid-air lightning hitting planes has increased. And what's known as clear-air turbulence \u2014 which can't be detected by radar \u2014 is increasing. As the jet stream shifts, warmer air, spurred by carbon dioxide emissions, is causing more wind shear at the elevations where planes usually cruise. One 2023 study found moderate clear-air turbulence has increased 37% between 1979-2020 \u2014 and researchers found severe clear-air turbulence increased 55% along one of the world's most popular travel routes, over the North Atlantic, in the same time period. Multiple\u00a0people were hospitalized\u00a0in 2023 when a Lufthansa flight from Austin, Texas, to Frankfurt, Germany, was forced to make an emergency landing at Dulles International Airport in Virginia because of turbulence. The flight was carrying 172 passengers and 12 crew members, according to Lufthansa. The decision to divert the flight to Dulles came as the plane experienced \"severe turbulence\" while flying over Tennessee, the FAA said in a statement to CBS News. Seven people were transported to local hospitals, Dulles airport said. A similar incident occurred just one day later, when around\u00a020 passengers and crew members\u00a0on board a Condor flight from Frankfurt to Mauritius were injured because of turbulence, the German news agency DPA reported. The plane hit a patch of turbulence about two hours before landing, an airline spokesperson said, according to DPA. The extent of their injuries was not immediately clear, but the plane, carrying 272 passengers and 13 crew members, eventually landed safely near Port Louis, the capital city of Mauritius, the news agency reported. Additional reports of passenger and crew injuries caused by airplane turbulence raised concerns on several occasions in 2022. In December,\u00a036 people were\u00a0hurt \u2014 20 of them were hospitalized, with 11 suffering serious injuries \u2014 when a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Phoenix to Honolulu experienced \"severe turbulence,\" officials said. Eight people were\u00a0hospitalized\u00a0that July after an American Airlines flight from Tampa, Florida, to Nashville, Tennessee, experienced severe \"unexpected turbulence\" and was forced to land in Alabama, a spokesperson for Birmingham's airport told CBS News. The incident came\u00a0weeks\u00a0after three Southwest Airlines flight attendants and one passenger on a flight from Chicago to Salt Lake City suffered minor injuries after their flight experienced \"moderate turbulence,\" according to the airline. But if caught unprepared, the sudden jolt caused by turbulence \u2014 or anything else \u2014 can lead to injuries to passengers and crew members who are not buckled in, the FAA warned. In 2023,\u00a0one person was killed\u00a0when a Bombardier CL30 jet headed from Dillant-Hopkins Airport in New Hampshire to Leesburg Executive Airport in Virginia jolted suddenly. The corporate jet was forced to divert to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, and the woman, 55-year-old Dana Hyde, died at a nearby hospital of what the state medical examiner said were blunt-force injuries to her head and neck. In an effort to reduce injuries caused by turbulence, the FAA has pushed new safety measures to reduce the likelihood of commercial airlines experiencing turbulence, such as encouraging pilots to file more reports and working to modernize the Pilot Report System where pilots communicate weather conditions, the agency said.\u00a0 In addition, the FAA said they are working with air carriers to get passengers to follow seatbelt instructions from crew members by making more frequent announcements during bouts of turbulence or through video presentations, as well as working with air carriers to design training programs to help prevent flight attendants from sustaining turbulence-related injuries. Garland said passengers' best bet is to follow crew instructions as well as buckling up. \"We would recommend listening to flight attendants and pilots,\" she told CBS News. \"That seatbelt sign comes on for a reason. You should not be up or going to the bathroom. That sign is on for your safety, but some passengers may think 'Oh, I'll be fine,' but with turbulence, you can injure yourself and other people around you.\" \"Take that seatbelt sign seriously, anytime it is on you should be seated and with your seatbelt on,\" Garland said.\u00a0 Garland also said some procedural changes could also help.\u00a0 \"Two things: Increasing time seated before landing, and giving flight attendants the ability to secure the cabin and discontinue service in anticipation for turbulence \u2014 that could help limit turbulence-related injuries.\" Tracy J.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \n    By\n                        \n              Len Ramirez, \n                              \n              Molly McCrea\n \nUpdated on:  April 25, 2024 / 7:32 PM PDT\n          / CBS San Francisco\n         SAN FRANCISCO BAY -- Bay Area scientists are using cutting-edge technology to better understand the decline in bird populations while finding ways to help species that are challenged.   In the past 50 years, nearly 30% of the birds in North America, some 3 billion birds, have vanished due primarily to habitat loss, pollution, and now climate change.\u00a0 At the southern edge of the bay surrounded by urban sprawl, native and migratory birds have found a haven on a tiny strip of forest. \"This is a little island of natural habitat for everything that lives here, specifically we watch the birds,\" explained Katie LaBarbera, science director with the Land Bird Program at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory. \"With climate change, these ecosystems are being impacted, these species are being impacted often in a negative way.\" She manages the Coyote Creek Field Station in Milpitas. Over the past 40 years, volunteers with the non-profit have studied birds at this year-round bird banding station. They've seen a worrisome decline in some species. To shed light on the issue, LaBarbera and her team collect data, using a traditional research method known as \"bird banding.\"\u00a0Birds are caught gently using special soft nets, they are weighed and their feathers are inspected for diseases or opportunistic infections or pests. Researchers examine them for fat deposits and any signs of molting. A lightweight band engraved with a unique ID number is then fitted around its leg like a loose bracelet before the bird is released. If the banded bird is caught again, the identification on the bracelet allows scientists to keep track of its movement. But there is a big downside: the recapture rates are very, very low. \"You recapture a very low percentage of all the birds you band,\" noted LaBarbera. \"So you must band a lot of birds to have any of them turn up at another station.\" Now, a game-changing technology is blowing researchers away. It's called the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. The tracking system is an international collaborative research network. Motus uses radio transmitters to simultaneously track wildlife across vast distances in real-time across the globe, revealing incredible new details. The system has been used on the East Coast for some time. Now, stations are being set up along the Pacific Coast. \u00a0\"We've never been able to see data like this on the West Coast before,\" exclaimed LaBarbera. \"It's been very exciting,\" proclaimed Levi Souza. Souza is a Senior Environmental Scientist with the California Department of Fish & Wildlife. He heads up the Department's Motus Program. \"We have these big gaps in our knowledge about the basic life history of a lot of wildlife and to be able to fill in those gaps it's very gratifying.\" To date, California has more than 50 Motus stations with antennas strategically placed from the Oregon border to the Salton Sea at the southern end of the state.  Souza brought CBS News Bay Area to Grizzly Island, where his group manages the Motus tower there. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife put up its first station around the start of 2021. \"Usually, one station per property is all that's really required to cover anything that might be moving by or using that property,\" explained Souza. With Motus, researchers attach tiny tracking tags to small birds, bats - even butterflies and bees. When the wildlife flies by a tower, the tag emits a unique, encoded radio signal, that gets picked up by the antenna. The range can be up to 12 miles. The signal then goes to the cloud and ends up in a central database.  \"Then it's available for the public to take a look at and also researchers,\" noted the scientist. Some of the nanotags are solar-powered, others have batteries. They are much cheaper than GPS tags that are better for bigger animals such as whales and sharks. There are now 1,200 Motus stations across 31 countries monitoring at least 250 species of birds, bats, and insects. Souza told CBS News Bay Area that some of the data he's seen on the Motus website is stunning and eye-opening. \"We've had detections of Western meadowlarks in the Central Valley, in the northern part of the Valley that were tagged in Montana,\" declared Souza. What is key and remarkable with Motus is that researchers around the world are pooling their resources and sharing the data. The hope is that by collaborating, the scientists will more quickly understand where the birds are spending time, and identify which areas are the most important to protect, as the planet continues to warm. Climate change is a huge concern for these scientists. \u00a0\"Yes. I'm very concerned,\" said LaBarbera. At the Coyote Creek Field Station, researchers erected a Motus tower and station. So far, they have attached nanotags to four birds: two hermit thrushes and two song sparrows. The San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory hopes to tag 10 more wild birds in the next few weeks. LaBarbera hopes that the warming planet, the data - and humans - will help give these birds a fighting chance. \"The more we slow climate change, the better,\" said the scientist, hoping for more than just a wing and a prayer.

Motus uses radio transmitters to simultaneously track wildlife across vast distances in real-time across the globe, revealing incredible new details. The system has been used on the East Coast for some time. Now, stations are being set up along the Pacific Coast. \u00a0\"We've never been able to see data like this on the West Coast before,\" exclaimed LaBarbera. \"It's been very exciting,\" proclaimed Levi Souza. Souza is a Senior Environmental Scientist with the California Department of Fish & Wildlife. He heads up the Department's Motus Program. \"We have these big gaps in our knowledge about the basic life history of a lot of wildlife and to be able to fill in those gaps it's very gratifying.\" To date, California has more than 50 Motus stations with antennas strategically placed from the Oregon border to the Salton Sea at the southern end of the state.  Souza brought CBS News Bay Area to Grizzly Island, where his group manages the Motus tower there. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife put up its first station around the start of 2021. \"Usually, one station per property is all that's really required to cover anything that might be moving by or using that property,\" explained Souza. With Motus, researchers attach tiny tracking tags to small birds, bats - even butterflies and bees. When the wildlife flies by a tower, the tag emits a unique, encoded radio signal, that gets picked up by the antenna. The range can be up to 12 miles. The signal then goes to the cloud and ends up in a central database.  \"Then it's available for the public to take a look at and also researchers,\" noted the scientist. Some of the nanotags are solar-powered, others have batteries. They are much cheaper than GPS tags that are better for bigger animals such as whales and sharks. There are now 1,200 Motus stations across 31 countries monitoring at least 250 species of birds, bats, and insects. Souza told CBS News Bay Area that some of the data he's seen on the Motus website is stunning and eye-opening. \"We've had detections of Western meadowlarks in the Central Valley, in the northern part of the Valley that were tagged in Montana,\" declared Souza. What is key and remarkable with Motus is that researchers around the world are pooling their resources and sharing the data. The hope is that by collaborating, the scientists will more quickly understand where the birds are spending time, and identify which areas are the most important to protect, as the planet continues to warm. Climate change is a huge concern for these scientists. \u00a0\"Yes. I'm very concerned,\" said LaBarbera. At the Coyote Creek Field Station, researchers erected a Motus tower and station. So far, they have attached nanotags to four birds: two hermit thrushes and two song sparrows. The San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory hopes to tag 10 more wild birds in the next few weeks. LaBarbera hopes that the warming planet, the data - and humans - will help give these birds a fighting chance. \"The more we slow climate change, the better,\" said the scientist, hoping for more than just a wing and a prayer."
