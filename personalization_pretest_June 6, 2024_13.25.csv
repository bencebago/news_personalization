Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study. 



This project is conducted by Dr. Bence Bago at Tilburg University. Your contribution to this research is highly valued and appreciated. Following is important information about this study and corresponding rules. Please read this carefully and ask any questions, before agreeing upon participation.



Purpose

The purpose of this study is to investigate reader reactions to headlines. 



Nature and duration of the study

We kindly request you to complete a questionnaire which should take less than 15 minutes of your time (including text reading). 



You will be asked about your basic demographics without any identifying information (i.e. you will not be asked your name or email address). The questionnaire will involve questions about your beliefs and views on science and technology. Finally, you will be shown a set of headlines, and asked about your anticipated reactions to the article belonging to that headline (i.e., your anticipated feelings). In the rare experience that you experience any stress, please be aware that you can reach the principal investigators of this study via the email addresses provided below.
