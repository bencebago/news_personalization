        "text": "Creatures as diverse as black bears and cuckoos provide a natural and eco-friendly solution to managing unwelcome insects. Long before chemicals and sprays, citronella candles, and DEET, nature provided predators for all the critters that humans find pesky. Bats binge on biting flies, frogs feast on mosquitoes, and swallows, well, swallow wasps. Frogs and toads can eat so many mosquitoes, in fact, that one 2022 study traced a spike in human cases of malaria with an amphibian disease outbreak in parts of Central America. Other studies have shown some bats can eat up to a thousand mosquitoes an hour. (Read why bats are the real superheroes of nature.) \u201cMost species are controlled very well \u2026 by natural enemies,\u201d says Douglas Tallamy, the TA Baker Professor of Agriculture at the University of Delaware. While such well-known pest-control species get a lot of attention, plenty of other animals spend their days\u2014or nights\u2014seeking out and gorging on summertime insects, in some cases evolving specialized skills to devour their prey. Here are some the most intriguing. Winnie the Pooh may have loved honey, but when real bears dig up beehives it\u2019s much less for sticky, sweet sugar than it is for white, squishy grubs.\u00a0 While opportunistic American black bears will eat just about anything from human garbage to fields of sunflowers to an occasional deer fawn, they will, at times, also specialize in insects, including wasp species as aggressive as yellow jackets. Ages 7-12 \u201cThey\u2019re after the larvae,\u201d says David Garshelis, chairperson for the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Bear Specialist Group. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them dig out a nest and they get stung the same way we do\u201d before continuing to forage. (Learn how black bears are rebounding throughout North America.) In some parts of North America, as black bears wait for berries to ripen, the omnivores maintain their body weight or even put on fat almost entirely by eating protein-rich ants, such as yellow ants. In case you thought all mosquitoes are virus-carrying, hike-ruining flying monsters, think again. Some mosquitoes, like Toxorhynchites rutilus septentrionalis, native to the U.S. Southeast, make their living eating other mosquitoes. T. septentrionalis larvae, which live in pockets of standing water like tree hollows, devour other smaller mosquito larvae, including species that spread human diseases. In the laboratory, one T. septentrionalis mosquito larva will kill between 20 and 50 other mosquito larvae a day. Intriguingly, these larvae are surplus killers, dispatching their victims but not eating them, according to a 2022 paper.\u00a0 \u201cIf compulsive killing occurs naturally, it can increase the effectiveness of\u00a0Toxorhynchites\u00a0as agents of control of blood-sucking mosquitoes,\u201d the authors write.\u00a0 For many bird species, nothing beats a tasty cache of thousands of caterpillars\u2014unless those caterpillars are covered in prickly hairs that can irritate your insides. But not the yellow-billed cuckoo of North America. This relatively large bird with a striking yellow beak can handle gorging on hairy caterpillars by periodically shedding the lining of its esophagus and stomach\u2014creating an offal akin to an owl pellet\u2014then starting over again. (Watch a caterpillar transform into a butterfly.) While species such as tent caterpillars and fall webworms are native to North America, their numbers periodically explode, giving yellow-billed cuckoos a feast of unimaginable proportion, with some research showing they can eat up to a hundred caterpillars in one sitting. Neither caterpillar species are all that bothersome to plants or humans, but they do provide valuable food for a bird that goes on to eat any number of other insects.\u00a0 If you ever see a bright red eastern newt scuttling along a trail in the eastern U.S., whisper a word of thanks. These long-lived salamanders\u2014many make it 12 to or even 15 years\u2014eat disease-carrying mosquitoes at every stage of their lives, from larvae to juveniles to adults.\u00a0 JJ Apodaca, executive director of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, can\u2019t say exactly how many mosquito larvae an eastern newt may consume in a day, but the creatures have voracious appetites and exist at high enough numbers to \u201cmake an impact\u201d on mosquito populations. The summer tanager may be beautiful with its flashy red body, but that\u2019s likely little consolation to the wasps the tanagers swipe out of the air, carry back to a tree, and beat to death on a branch. Summer tanagers, which live throughout the southern U.S. and migrate each year to South America, dine mostly on insects. But unlike most other birds, the summer tanager specializes on bees and wasps. To avoid being stung, they catch wasps like yellow jackets from the air, and, once dispatched, rub the stingers off on a branch before dining, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. They will also tear apart nests to eat wasp larvae packed with protein. While natural pest control is diverse, Tallamy says, \u201cthe heavy hand of humans has messed up that diversity.\u201d In many cases, human-caused impacts such as habitat loss, climate change, and pollution may harm natural predators, such as birds and other critters. \u201cWe can\u2019t live on this planet by getting rid of insects,\u201d Tallamy says. \u201cThey are the little things that run the world.

        "title": "Why giant Antarctic sea spiders are surprisingly good dads",
        "text": "The spindly-legged creatures, which are not closely related to spiders, defy expectations of fatherhood in the animal kingdom. Any schoolkid will tell you seahorse dads carry their babies. But sea spiders? There are 1,500 species of these long, spindly-legged denizens, found in oceans worldwide, and most are doting fathers that care for their unborn young. They range from tiny creatures roaming intertidal pools to behemoths stalking the polar depths. The fact that male sea spiders play such a big role in raising offspring just adds to their smorgasbord of strangeness. Though they\u2019re arthropods\u2014the phylum that includes spiders, insects, and crustaceans\u2014sea spiders are not closely related to spiders. In fact, these animals also have a tiny body and store all their internal organs in their limbs. \u201cThey\u2019re all legs,\u201d says Felipe Barreto, an evolutionary biologist at Oregon State University. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of their own thing.\u201d (Read how sea spiders \u201cbreathe\u201d through their legs.) Now, a recent study on male giant Antarctic sea spiders, the world\u2019s largest, offers a new clue on how their fathering behavior may have arisen. In the past, male sea spiders may have attached eggs to a safe place, like a rock. Over the eons, the animals likely started gluing eggs on themselves to help their young survive\u2014providing them with an evolutionary advantage. In most sea spider species, males use ovigers, an extra set of little arms that aid in grooming and to attach fertilized eggs onto their bodies, says Claudia Arango, a sea spider expert at the Queensland Museum in Australia.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big job,\u201d she says. Methods of egg-carrying vary across species. For instance, some sea spiders package eggs in a mucus-y blob and carry it on their torso. Others roll their offspring into little balls. Some attach them directly to their legs. The males can carry these eggs for several weeks or months. When the eggs hatch, baby sea spiders, or larvae, often continue to cling onto the caring father for a period of time. They eventually crawl away when they find a food source like an anemone. Previously, no one knew if male Antarctic giant sea spiders also provided care. Males of these dinner plate-size spiders lack ovigers, and scientists had also never observed a male Antarctic sea spider carrying eggs. (See photos of excellent animal dads.) In the latest study, scientists captured Antarctic sea spiders from the wild and observed their mating and reproduction in the laboratory. The researchers found that, unlike other sea spiders, Antarctic giant sea spiders don\u2019t attach eggs to their bodies. Instead, they meticulously glue their eggs to a rock or other substrate at the bottom of the ocean. For two days, \u201cthe male just kind of walks around the egg mass and seems to be grooming it,\u201d says study leader Amy Moran, a marine physiological ecologist at the University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa. This behavior may provide a possible explanation on how male sea spiders evolved to be the primary parent. \u201cWe [now] have evidence of a species that does something in the middle. They're not quite attached to the body, which is very costly, but they still provide some care,\u201d says Barreto, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research. Adds Moran: \u201cIt sort of opens up this sort of new view of how that might have happened.\u00a0 Some research shows carrying eggs can be a huge sacrifice for males. Eggs can weigh him down and make him less able to clean or take care of himself, says Barreto.\u00a0 Sometimes males carry so many egg masses, his body is no longer visible. That can make them more susceptible to threats like parasites. \"It can take a lot of energy,\" Barreto says.\u00a0(Read about the pesky hitchhikers that make life miserable for Antarctic sea spiders.) \u00a0Why male sea spiders invest so many resources into their offspring, however, is unknown. The females, in this case, are often only present during mating, when she lets go of her fertilized eggs. Regardless, learning about sea spider males reveals how little we know about the marine arthropods, and how the animal kingdom can subvert expectations. \u201cEvery expedition to a remote island or remote seamount, scientists come back with new species with something new that we didn't, we didn't know,\u201d says Arango. For instance, recent research has found that sea spiders can regenerate segments of their bodies. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement that comes with finding such fascinating creatures,\u201d says Arango. \u201cThey\u2019re full of mysteries.\" Ages 7-12 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "text": "\u201cThere are prophecies about white buffalo calves being born at a time of great change,\u201d says one expert. How rare are white bison\u2014and what does this birth mean? It\u2019s not often that the birth of a wild animal causes a stir among so many different groups of people, but a white American bison calf photographed in Wyoming has done just that. \u201cWe\u2019re in Yellowstone this week and just missed this birth by a few minutes!\u201d wrote photographer Erin Braaten in a Facebook post on June 4. \u201cA white bison calf!!\u201d News of the birth quickly spread around the world after that.\u00a0 Images of albino, yellow, or blonde animals\u2014from giraffes, tapirs, and monkeys to cougars, badgers, and frogs and snakes\u2014often fascinate the public. But this pale bison, also known as an American buffalo, has special significance in Indigenous cultures.\u00a0 \u201cThere are prophecies about white buffalo calves being born at a time of great change,\u201d says Jason Baldes, a member of the Eastern Shoshone tribe and executive director of the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative. \u201cWe have stories of the Eastern Shoshone people hunting and pursuing white bison or white buffalo from well over a century ago.\u201d (At long last, the American buffalo has come home.) Buffalo used to roam from Alaska to Mexico and number between 30 to 60 million. Although that population was driven down to just 325 animals by 1884, scientists and conservationists have since rescued bison from the brink of extinction. But most of the 30,000 buffalo that exist today aren\u2019t as free or as wild as you might think. Ages 7-12 \u201cWith the momentum that we see with bison restoration and conservation, I think this will help to bring awareness about the importance of, not only the sacredness of that white buffalo calf, but also the issue of [buffalo] existing as wildlife,\u201d says Baldes, who is also a National Geographic Explorer. While studies about the frequency of albinism or leucism have taken place in animals such as penguins, white buffalo are much less studied. One statistic bandied about online, and misattributed to the National Bison Association, is that a white buffalo calf will occur in one out of every 10 million births.\u00a0 (Rare \"blonde\" penguin spotted in Antarctica. See the photo.) \u201cTo my knowledge, no one has kept consistent records of white buffalo being born,\u201d says Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association. \u201cTherefore it\u2019s tough to make a determination of occurrence.\u201d At least anecdotally speaking, there haven\u2019t been many in the last few decades, says Robert Pickering, author of Seeing the White Buffalo. Most of the white bison you do hear about actually come from cross-breeding bison and white Charolais cattle. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of private producers, folks that are in the bison industry, that realize that there\u2019s a lot of attention garnered from white bison calves,\u201d says Baldes. \u201cAnd that really is not a good thing in terms of conservation for bison.\u201d Matheson and the National Bison Association agree. \u201cOur code of ethics would forbid that type of cross breeding,\u201d he says. The other, less common ways you can get a white bison would be examples of albinism or leucism, genetic conditions that affect pigmentation. Bison with albinism would have pink eyes, hooves, and noses, while leucistic animals lack pigment in some but not all of their tissues. (What is albinism\u2014and how's it different from leucism?) Pickering\u2019s book catalogued another instance of the latter in Wisconsin in 1994. Named Miracle, that buffalo was born with white fur, but black eyes, hooves, and nose. It\u2019s the animals with these leucistic features that appear across many Native American cultures, from the Sioux to the Cherokee. The new calf appears to be of that same sacred variety, says Pickering. \u201cNow, the interesting part about Miracle, and we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s going to be true about this new calf,\u201d says Pickering, \u201calthough it was born with a white pelage, Miracle turned nearly black when she got her winter coat.\u201d Even more curious, as the seasons changed, Miracle next turned reddish and then yellowish. \u201cRed, yellow, black and white are the four sacred Lakota colors,\u201d Pickering says. \u201cSo in a sense, that verified that she was a spiritual being.\u201d \u201cThe birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning,\u201d Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, told the Associated Press. \u201cWe must do more,\u201d says Looking Horse, who is the 19th keeper of the White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle, a sacred artifact to his people. As senior buffalo program manager through the National Wildlife Federation's Tribal Partnerships Program and vice president to the InterTribal Buffalo Council, Baldes has been working to restore bison to tribes that want to have them.\u00a0 \u201cWe, the Eastern Shoshone, call ourselves the Buffalo Eaters, the Gweechoondeka, even though they were missing from our diet for well over 130 years,\u201d says Baldes. \u201cMost buffalo exists today in private herds and ranches,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are essentially ecologically extinct.\u201d One way to remedy this is to buy land and release bison onto it. So far, the InterTribal Buffalo Council has managed to acquire 25,000 wild bison across 65 herds held on tribal land. More recently, at Wind River, Baldes helped get approval to convert 17,000 acres of cattle pasture into bison habitat. \u201cThe limitation, often-times for tribes, is land,\u201d he says. Restoring bison to the landscape is of the utmost importance, he argues\u2014and not only for the ancient eco-cultural importance that this species holds for Native American tribes. \u201cThey increase plant and animal biodiversity. That should be reason enough,\u201d says Baldes. Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved",

The new calf appears to be of that same sacred variety, says Pickering. \u201cNow, the interesting part about Miracle, and we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s going to be true about this new calf,\u201d says Pickering, \u201calthough it was born with a white pelage, Miracle turned nearly black when she got her winter coat.\u201d Even more curious, as the seasons changed, Miracle next turned reddish and then yellowish. \u201cRed, yellow, black and white are the four sacred Lakota colors,\u201d Pickering says. \u201cSo in a sense, that verified that she was a spiritual being.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning,\u201d Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, told the Associated Press. \u201cWe must do more,\u201d says Looking Horse, who is the 19th keeper of the White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle, a sacred artifact to his people. As senior buffalo program manager through the National Wildlife Federation's Tribal Partnerships Program and vice president to the InterTribal Buffalo Council, Baldes has been working to restore bison to tribes that want to have them. \n\n\u201cWe, the Eastern Shoshone, call ourselves the Buffalo Eaters, the Gweechoondeka, even though they were missing from our diet for well over 130 years,\u201d says Baldes. \u201cMost buffalo exists today in private herds and ranches,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are essentially ecologically extinct.\u201d One way to remedy this is to buy land and release bison onto it. So far, the InterTribal Buffalo Council has managed to acquire 25,000 wild bison across 65 herds held on tribal land. More recently, at Wind River, Baldes helped get approval to convert 17,000 acres of cattle pasture into bison habitat. \u201cThe limitation, often-times for tribes, is land,\u201d he says. Restoring bison to the landscape is of the utmost importance, he argues\u2014and not only for the ancient eco-cultural importance that this species holds for Native American tribes. \u201cThey increase plant and animal biodiversity. That should be reason enough,\u201d says Baldes."

        "text": "The 10-foot-long arapaima was quickly disappearing in Brazil until local communities stepped in to save it\u2014and themselves. Giant freshwater fish are among the most endangered animals on Earth. But in the lush waterways of the Amazon, one leviathan is swimming against the current. Meet the arapaima, a fish capable of growing up to 10 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds. Just over a decade ago, this popular seafood species faced extinction, its numbers ravaged by overfishing. But conservation efforts spearheaded by local communities have turned things around for the arapaima, with populations increasing dramatically across the Amazon. (Read about efforts to save the world\u2019s biggest freshwater fish.) In areas where communities have adopted sustainable fishing practices, arapaima numbers increased 425 percent in 11 years, according to research by Jo\u00e3o Campos-Silva, a Brazilian ecologist and National Geographic Explorer. He is part of the\u00a0National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition\u2014a two-year scientific exploration of the river basin. The number has since grown to 600 percent, though those results have not yet been published, he says. To date, Campos-Silva has worked with around 40 communities along the Juru\u00e1 River, a major Amazon tributary that traverses mostly pristine rainforest in western Brazil. Overall in the Amazon, around 1,100 communities have adopted conservation initiatives for the fish, which are listed as data deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The arapaima\u2019s resurgence is a conservation triumph that can serve as a blueprint for safeguarding other large aquatic species in the Amazon and globally, he says. And it highlights the crucial role of local communities in leading successful conservation endeavors. \u201cFor many, many decades, people have been looking to the outside for solutions to the problems in the Amazon, but the arapaima story shows that the answers are often in the hands of the local people and communities living in the forest,\u201d says Campos-Silva. Ages 7-12 \u201cThey are the knowledge keepers.\u201d Roughly the size of the contiguous United States, South America\u2019s Amazon Basin, 60 percent of which lies within Brazil\u2019s borders, is home to tens of millions of people, including around 400 Indigenous groups. The basin is crisscrossed by thousands of rivers with more fish species than in any other river system on Earth. The largest scaled freshwater fish in the world, the arapaima in Brazil is known as the \u201cpirarucu,\u201d a word in the aboriginal Tup\u00ed language that translates to \u201cred fish,\u201d after its reddish tail. Prowling the region\u2019s lakes and swamps, the predatory arapaima is an air breather that can only stay submerged for 10 to 20 minutes before resurfacing to breathe using a specialized, lung-like swim bladder. This surfacing behavior makes arapaimas easy to catch. A 2014 study found their demand as seafood led to severe overfishing that depleted populations in three out of four of the fishing communities surveyed; the fish completely disappeared from a fifth. By then, Brazil\u2019s government had set up an extensive network of protected areas throughout the Amazon, with several states banning arapaima fishing. To better manage the species, scientists also developed a method to count arapaimas in their lake habitats, drawing inspiration from techniques used to survey breaching whales in the ocean. The individuals most skilled at counting the fish were those who know them best: fishermen. \u201cIn the split second that an arapaima comes to the surface, an experienced fisherman can tell you the size, weight, and direction of its movement,\u201d says Leandro Castello, a tropical ecologist at Virginia Tech\u2019s Global Change Center who developed the arapaima-counting model. About 15 years ago, Campos-Silva, who initially worked on birds before turning his attention to Amazonian biodiversity, began working along the Juru\u00e1 River, collaborating closely with the residents of the tight-knit S\u00e3o Raimundo community. He also supported the efforts of a local group called the Association of Rural Producers of Carauari to manage arapaima protected areas. The S\u00e3o Raimundo community integrated their traditional knowledge with scientific methodologies, effectively making the conservation efforts their own, he says. \u201cThey had seen the decline in their fisheries and were eager to find solutions to improve the situation,\u201d he says. (Read more about how scientists are saving megafishes.) Based on fish counts, the community established a sustainable catch quota, with the federal government permitting an arapaima harvest of up to 30 percent of adults in protected areas. Fish under five feet long could not be harvested.\u00a0 Most arapaimas spawn just after seasonal floodwaters rise and spread into the forest. When waters recede during the dry season, the fish are confined to isolated lakes and river channels. It's during this time that fishing operations are allowed. The actions produced almost immediate results: Arapaima numbers, boosted by the species' exceptionally rapid growth rate, swiftly recovered. As other Juru\u00e1 River communities adopted the strategy, Campos-Silva was stunned by the economic and social benefits it yielded for local people. In addition to households making more money, improved fishing earnings were reinvested in local schools, health centers, and basic infrastructure. \u201cPeople realized that through conservation, they can have a better life,\u201d he says. The community-driven initiatives have also enhanced the status of women, who, despite constituting nearly half of the global fisheries workforce, frequently go unacknowledged and unpaid. Women in the Brazilian Amazon are increasingly taking on roles aboard boats and participating more actively in decision-making processes, research shows. \u201cOur research shows that women are now for the first time earning their own money from Amazonian fishing, which is helping to eradicate general poverty,\u201d says Campos-Silva. In 2018, Campos-Silva founded Instituto Juru\u00e1, a Manaus-based nonprofit promoting biodiversity conservation and improved quality of life for local communities. He has since expanded his work to other parts of the Brazilian Amazon as well as the Ucayali River in Peru, another major tributary of the Amazon River with a large Indigenous population. He and other scientists continue to gain deeper insights into the movement, ecology, and population dynamics of the arapaima, including through tagging and radio-tracking fish. For instance, they\u2019ve found that for a population of arapaima to be deemed healthy, there should be a minimum of 30 individual fish per square kilometer of floodplain. The community-based conservation approach has yielded even more spectacular results in Guyana, with arapaima populations there increasing tenfold since the turn of the millennium, says Donald Stewart, a fisheries professor at State University of New York. Yet there are still many unmanaged areas of the Amazon where arapaimas may be going locally extinct. \u201cVast areas still don\u2019t have rigorous population counts or local engagement to protect the fishes from outsiders,\u201d he says. Stewart believes the arapaima could be the largest freshwater fish on Earth. Studying growth ring deposition on the scales of arapaimas living in Guyana\u2019s Essequibo River have shown those animals may grow much heavier than those from central Brazil, Stewart says. His research has shown there are several more distinct species of arapaimas, and some could still be considered critically endangered. (Read about a new arapaima species announced in 2016.) Unmanaged movements of arapaima around Brazil could lead to disease transfer and genetic mixing among these potentially distinct populations, issues that remain largely unstudied. For Zeb Hogan, a biology professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a National Geographic Explorer, the arapaima conservation success can be a model for protecting and managing populations of other endangered giant fish around the world. \u201cThese results buck an otherwise gloomy trend of severe decline of most species of aquatic megafauna,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare example of a win-win solution that can be replicated in many areas worldwide.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "This tiny Florida gecko is disappearing\u2014can we save it before it\u2019s too late?",
        "text": "The overlooked reptile is earning state-level protections, but it may not be enough to save the species. Beneath dried leaves and palm fronds, the Florida reef gecko lives in relative obscurity. The two-inch critters have speckled brown bodies that blend in with the forest floor, and they can dart off in the blink of an eye. But for such a tiny reptile, it faces some large threats: notably, urban development in one of the fastest growing U.S. states and sea level rise due to climate change. In May, Florida\u2019s wildlife agency decided to move forward with plans to list the reef gecko as threatened, three years after scientists warned that its historic range has dwindled\u2014and what remains is at high risk of going underwater by the end of the century. These geckos have already disappeared completely from nine spots, and their habitat has been reduced to 41 percent of its original size in less than a century, according to recent research. At the same time, South Florida\u2019s stretch of the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to rise between one and three feet by 2080, according to NOAA. \u201cOur concerns with the reef gecko are loss of entire populations,\u201d says Stephanie Clements, a conservation biologist now at the Tropical Audubon Society\u00a0who led a 2021 study describing dangers to the reef gecko. In a phenomenon called coastal squeeze, sea level rise will begin to swallow parts of the state, promoting people to move inland. But geckos can\u2019t follow. (See how sea level rise is already changing the Everglades.) \u201cIf you can't travel more than a hundred meters in 10 or 20 generations, you're not really going to be able to outrun potential problems like sea level rise,\u201d says Aaron Bauer, a biology professor at Villanova University who reviewed the Florida listing proposal as an outside expert. Ages 7-12 If sea levels rise by seven feet, biologists expect 85 percent of the gecko\u2019s habitat to go underwater. But there\u2019s more to the story. Some scientists say the reef gecko might not belong in Florida at all. In a state overrun with invasive reptiles, the Florida reef gecko is a rarity: It\u2019s the only gecko native to the eastern United States and lives in small pockets of South Florida\u2019s tropical hardwood hammocks, an ecosystem that provides a cool, dry refuge for the gecko and many other species. At Miami\u2019s Simpson Park, a protected hammock preserve, an entire reef gecko population lives within the confines of just eight acres, but \u201cthere's no guarantee that it's viable in the long-term,\u201d says conservation biologist Christopher Searcy, a co-author on the 2021 study and head of the Searcy Lab at the University of Miami.\u00a0 \u201cOf course, coastal areas are where humans most want to develop, so the tropical hardwood hammocks along the coast are highly fragmented,\u201d Searcy says. (Read about a Florida law enacted to protect wildlife corridors.) This habitat is also right in the path of hurricanes, which are becoming more intense due to the changing climate. Protecting other parts of the geckos' remaining habitat from development could help other species as well, says Clements. The rim rock crowned snake, for instance, is threatened in Florida and may be declared federally endangered. Both are important predators in their ecosystems: Reef geckos dine on insects such as beetles, bees, wasps, ants, butterfly and moth larvae, and worms, keeping the hardwood hammock\u2019s forest floor ecosystem in balance. Although the Florida reef gecko is considered a Florida native, some scientists aren't sure. The earliest written record of reef geckos in Florida dates back to 1858 in Key West, a bustling port where geckos could have easily hitched a ride on cargo. But earlier genetic data trace to Key Largo, a more northern island where trade wasn\u2019t as common. This would imply that the geckos rafted to Florida from the Caribbean on their own, if they weren\u2019t already there. (Go inside the debate over whether Florida's flamingoes are native.) The Florida populations are categorized as the subspecies Sphaerodactylus notatus notatus, but the species occurs across the Caribbean. Over its entire range, the reef gecko isn\u2019t as imperiled.\u00a0 \u201cI still think the jury is out,\u201d says Tony Gamble, a herpetologist at Marquette University in Wisconsin who studies dwarf geckos\u2014a group to which the Florida reef gecko belongs\u2014and their evolution.\u00a0 Resolving the controversy would require comparing genetic samples from South Florida with those in Cuba or the Bahamas. \u201cAre you preserving something that's part of Florida's native heritage? Things that are native to Florida should be prioritized,\u201d he says. For now, state officials agree that the Florida population is resident.\u00a0 Now that Florida has listed the gecko as a candidate for the threatened species list, state scientists will draft a management plan by 2025 that outlines the animal's protections in more detail. \u201cWhat's going to be really critical to effectively conserving the species is thinking ahead into the future and having a really strong recovery plan,\u201d says Elise Bennett, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit that advocates for endangered species. (Read about a Florida ecosystem that's a battleground for development.) Part of that will be stricter building permits. At the state level, developers can easily find loopholes for so-called cryptic species\u2014those that are difficult to find because they live underground or are otherwise elusive, Bennett says. What\u2019s more, the listing process takes years. \u201cDecisions still need to be made,\u201d Gamble says. We \u201cdon't have a lot of time for people to sort everything out.\u201d Microscale critters such as the reef gecko also represent a large gap in conservation, he adds. \u201cLittle things need conserving, and they are being affected just as much as the big, charismatic megafauna,\u201d Gamble says. \u201cFor every elephant or panda, you\u2019ve got dozens or hundreds of these little things that are in the same boat.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "text": "Though the species has bounced back from the endangered list, they\u2019re facing the second starvation event in two years. For the second time in two years, large numbers of brown pelicans are showing up sick and injured along California\u2019s coastline, and scientists are racing to find out why.\u00a0 As of this week, hundreds of these birds have died. Current evidence points to starvation as the cause, despite there being plenty of food (typically surface dwelling fish like herring or anchovies) for them to eat. Though the species are also found on the east coast of the U.S., the Atlantic birds aren\u2019t suffering a similar trend. \u201cWe don't know why, but [the west coast pelicans] are not finding the food that they need,\u201d says Jeni Smith, the zoological curator of animal rescue programs at SeaWorld San Diego. \u201cAnd if that's the case, then they are looking for it elsewhere, and that might explain why they are inland or in unusual locations.\u201d In late April, wildlife rehabilitation centers began to receive reports of pelicans being spotted in abnormal locations such as people\u2019s backyards and parking lots, with many displaying puzzling behavior and appearing sluggish, unresponsive, or severely emaciated.\u00a0 After these animals are picked up, wildlife experts are essentially stuck working triage. \u201cThey're dehydrated, they're lethargic, they're cold, they may have an injury,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe do as much as we possibly can, and sometimes they just come in and it's just too late.\u201d Sickened brown pelicans have been a mix of juveniles and those older and fully grown\u2014with big bills, broad wings and bodies that make plunge-diving for supper look easy. They\u2019re known for swooping down from heights of more than 60 feet to catch their prey and can live up to 40 years. Ages 7-12 Experts are investigating what other factors may be behind the reason the brown pelicans, which have bounced back from the federal endangered list, are once again washing up dead.\u00a0 During a similar starvation event in 2022, nearly eight hundred brown pelicans were admitted to wildlife rehab centers, with 394 eventually returned to the wild, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Unfortunately, animal necropsies done on deceased pelicans failed to reveal any answers behind the reason for that event, Smith says.\u00a0 So far this year, 116 pelicans have been taken in by the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network (SBWCN), a number that is still dwarfed by the 270 reported a few years ago.\u00a0 \u201cThis won't be the last time that we get an influx of a particular species related to something that's going on in their environment,\u201d says Ariana Katovich, the executive director of the SBWCN. \u201cSo for us, it's really about learning the lessons from each event and implementing them.\u201d The cause of this year\u2019s crisis also remains largely unknown, but some interesting speculations are flying about. One theory is that the weather may be to blame, as powerful winds or low visibility could be preventing the pelicans from diving well enough to catch their meals. This may also better explain the influx of pelicans coming in with injuries caused by fishing gear, as hungry birds often get caught by fish hooks or ensnared in fishing lines.\u00a0 At one point, the birds were even checked for the avian flu that has newly infected\u00a0so many mammals this year, says Rebecca Duerr, director of research and veterinary science at International Bird Rescue. Luckily, none of the sickened pelicans tested positive for it.\u00a0 The death of so many pelicans also doesn\u2019t seem to be causing splashes for other kinds of marine life, at least not any that experts can see at the moment.\u00a0 What may be more challenging to discern is how much human-induced environmental change should be held responsible for, if not directly leading to, these animals\u2019 continued struggles. In the case of a species that has historically been a conservation success story, the brown pelican population is starving as it was two years ago, and that\u2019s the only thing experts know for sure, according to Laird Henkel, a senior environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any indication that it\u2019s directly human-caused,\u201d says Henkel. \u201cIt\u2019s not a human action of any kind that we\u2019re aware of.\u201d\u00a0 Those involved in brown pelican recovery efforts note that while you should keep their distance from them, humans can be of assistance by swiftly reporting an animal sighting to a local rescue center in the area and keeping an eye on it until help can arrive.\u00a0 Such an urgent response, says Katovich, can often mean the difference between life and death for a pelican that needs life-saving care.\u00a0 \u201cObviously the sooner we can get it, the better,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first 24 to 48 hours that animal is in care with us is the most critical time.\u201d\u00a0 Normally skittish and docile animals, treatment for the affected pelicans may involve assessing their body temperature and warming them as quickly as possible, offering them lots of nutrition and fluids to fend off dehydration, or stitching up wounds and giving them relevant medication.

        "text": "\u00a0 Galliformes include 290 species of quail, pheasants, turkeys, partridges, grouse, peacocks, guans, curassows, and guinea fowl. Prized as game birds and reared for their meat and eggs, these stout-bodied birds often have short, rounded wings because they spend most of their time on the ground. Their thick legs and big feet are adapted to regular walking, and suited for shallow digging to forage for seeds, roots, and insects. Some gallinaceous birds, like the turkey, sport ostentatious fleshy wattles that hang from their necks, or combs on the tops of their heads in bold colors like red or purple that can signal a male\u2019s health and desirability. These features are especially common in this ancient bird lineage, suggesting these traits could be evolutionary holdovers from the Galliformes\u2019 dinosaur ancestors. All Galliformes can fly, though when they do, most launch explosively with a quick burst skyward and then travel only a short distance\u2014a useful skill for escaping danger. A few outliers make longer flights, including Old World quails, which migrate from Europe to Africa and back again. Galliformes live on every continent except Antarctica. Ptarmigan inhabit a frigid, barren Arctic landscape year-round, foraging vegetation under the snow, while the Congo peacock lives in African rainforests eating fruits and insects. The scaled quail lives on seeds from grassland desert plants of the American Southwest, and wild turkeys thrive in forests\u2014and in suburban neighborhoods with plentiful bird feeders. Most species nest on the ground although, when possible, they may roost in trees at night. Some of these birds can be found in huge numbers, like the common quail found in the millions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some gallinaceous birds live in flocks or pairs, but most prioritize mating over enduring bonds. Galliform males often use brightly colored plumage and elaborate ornamentation to attract potential partners for the short term. For example, the peacock\u2019s famed eyespot plumage has been naturally selected to please the opposite sex. They\u2019ve proven so successful at helping males procreate, that several other Galliform species have evolved to display this plumage, including pheasants and peacock-pheasants. Males also use a repertoire of seductive moves to make an impression. Prairie chickens, for example, gather in groups\u00a0to strut their stuff. \u201cThey sing, dance, and have sex,\u201d says Kevin McGowan, a biologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. \u201cThat\u2019s basically it. The females do all the parental care, and the males are good for sperm and entertainment. There are a bunch of species like that.\u201d Males and females of other species, like quail, do work together, focusing most of their effort on tending eggs before they hatch. Unlike helpless hatchlings which must be kept alive, Galliformes usually emerge almost ready to fend for themselves. Among Australian brush-turkeys, males incubate eggs inside a compost heap the size of a Volkswagen. \u201cWhen they hatch they basically run off into the forest and never see their parents again,\u201d says McGowan. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird system, but they are entirely self-sufficient.\u201d More than a quarter of all Galliform species are classified as at risk by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In many cases, habitat loss is to blame, but it\u2019s not the only factor. \u201cA lot of it is the fact that they are game birds, and they are food birds,\u201d says McGowan. \u201cPeople definitely do overhunt them simply because they taste good.\u201d Most Galliformes\u2019 chests have big flight muscles optimized for short bursts, and leg muscles rich with blood vessels to provide them with oxygen and endurance for walking. Because their chest muscles are used less than other flying birds, like ducks, they have more white meat for white-meat loving consumers. Humans keep many gallinaceous species for meat and eggs, including chickens, which were originally domesticated from South East Asia\u2019s red jungle fowl as long as 9,500 years ago.

        "title": "These are the weird and wonderful reasons octopuses change shape and color",
        "text": "Camouflage isn't the only way cephalopods have evolved to change their appearance. Almost all cephalopods\u2014the class of ocean dwellers that includes octopuses, cuttlefish, and squids\u2014have an incredible ability not just to change the color and patterns on their skin, but also to transform their body\u2019s shape and texture. Thanks to these tricks, cephalopods can radically change their appearance faster than the blink of an eye, the swiftest known change in the animal kingdom. \u201cThey're the best at it of anything that we know,\u201d says Michael Vecchione, the curator of Cephalopoda at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. This is especially surprising since most cephalopods are color-blind, so we have yet to understand how they can fully perceive what to copy in the first place. \u201cIt has to have been evolutionarily important for them to evolve [the ability to change color and texture] and to evolve so many different versions of it,\u201d says Vecchione. Indeed, studies suggest that each cephalopod species has evolved up to 30 different ranges of patterns to hide in plain sight. This group of soft-bodied mollusks have skin covered in millions of pixel-like cells called chromatophores: pigment-filled sacs each surrounded by their own small muscle fiber. These muscles can stretch the chromatophore to flood with color\u00a0or contract and shrink to a dot, creating varied, complex patterns. Octopuses and cuttlefish are also covered in small bumps, flaps, branches, and ridges called papillae, which can be ruffled upwards or smoothed out to create different skin textures too. (Stream\u00a0Secrets of the Octopuses\u00a0now on Disney+ and Hulu) Ages 7-12 The common day octopus (Octopus cyanea) can become almost see-through beige and white on flat sandy surfaces; dark, mottled, and rugged on bumpy rocks; and flashes orange, red, and brown spikes along corals. Cuttlefish sometimes clump up, shrivel, and hide their arms to look like a tuft of algae, and baby giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama) hiding among seaweeds have been recorded sending waves of shaded dark brownish-green pigments across their body to copy the motion of swaying seaweed. While these shapeshifting skills certainly come in handy for inconspicuous disguises, there are many other reasons octopuses and other cephalopods change their skin\u2014and they may surprise you. Sometimes cephalopods need to do the opposite of blending in to escape a predator. If they\u2019ve been caught while in camouflage, many octopus species can turn their bodies dark and cloudy, darken their eyes, stretch out their body and arms to look bigger and stand taller. Cuttlefish even create eye-like shapes on their mantle \u2014 their sack-shaped body \u2014 back to stare down their predator. Predators learn to associate the highly venomous blue-ringed octopuses with the gaudy rings of indigo they flash across their yellow skin to alert predators they\u2019re not to be messed with. (8 fascinating facts about octopuses\u2014from their supersmarts to their favorite foods.) Meanwhile, the less-dangerous mimic octopuses (Thaumoctopus mimicus) impersonate all sorts of animals that are more threatening or venomous than they are. Among many other disguises, they can spread out their arms and display white and brown stripes to look like the sharp-spined, highly venomous lionfish. Mimicking other animals also helps cephalopods to appear less threatening and get close to their prey. Pharaoh cuttlefish (Sepia pharaonis) have been seen using their color, texture, and movement to appear as docile hermit crabs to their prey, the tropical damselfish. Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioide) swim in reverse and wave their arms like fins to look like herbivorous parrotfish, also to get close to their prey. Cephalopods can also send stripes, circles, and patterns of color across their body as if to bamboozle their prey before striking. Martin How, an ecology of vision researcher at the University of Bristol, studies how Broadclub cuttlefish (Sepia latimanus) ripple dramatic dark rings of color from their head to their arms as they get closer to their prey. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a magician trying to mesmerize, or hypnotize their audience,\u201d he says, theorizing this helps the cuttlefish is disguise its approach, looking farther than it is, to catch the prey off guard.

They likely use these signals to help organize swimming in schools during their daily vertical migration between deeper and shallower waters, according to Vecchione. (These creatures of the 'twilight zone' are vital to our oceans.)

Since small male Australian giant cuttlefish don\u2019t stand a chance in competing for a female when a larger male is around, they need to sneak around. They change their color and posture to impersonate females, get close to other females, then mate with them right under the larger male\u2019s nose. Some species of cuttlefish can literally split their mantle in half and show both patterns at once: a courtship pattern for the female, and a deceptive pattern for their rival. Though scientists have observed many interesting examples of color, shape, and texture changing seemingly to achieve a goal, research cannot yet point to any intentionality behind these signals\u2014like whether octopuses are consciously mimicking more threatening sea creatures. (An octopus invited this writer into her tank\u2014and her secret world.) \u201cIt doesn't mean that the octopus itself is aware of what it's doing,\u201d says Tessa Montague, a cephalopod neuroscientist at Columbia University. She says it\u2019s probably a case of natural selection: one of these animals might have started behaving this way, and they didn't get eaten. Montague\u2019s approach to studying cephalopods is using the color and pattern changes in their skin\u00a0to parse what\u2019s going on in their minds. For instance, when cephalopods display their threat patterns as they run away from predators, those are probably involuntary reactions to their brain activity, she says. Their skins are likely reflecting their fear, stress, aggression, or desire to mate.That\u2019s why footage of an octopus flickering different colors during its sleep has been used to study whether cephalopods dream during their slumber. \u201cWe argue that perhaps that is actually a physical manifestation of an internal state,\u201d says Montague. \u201cThey have this incredible electric skin that is basically showing you what they're thinking.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "onlytext": "Almost all cephalopods\u2014the class of ocean dwellers that includes octopuses, cuttlefish, and squids\u2014have an incredible ability not just to change the color and patterns on their skin, but also to transform their body\u2019s shape and texture. Thanks to these tricks, cephalopods can radically change their appearance faster than the blink of an eye, the swiftest known change in the animal kingdom. \u201cThey're the best at it of anything that we know,\u201d says Michael Vecchione, the curator of Cephalopoda at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. This is especially surprising since most cephalopods are color-blind, so we have yet to understand how they can fully perceive what to copy in the first place. \u201cIt has to have been evolutionarily important for them to evolve [the ability to change color and texture] and to evolve so many different versions of it,\u201d says Vecchione. Indeed, studies suggest that each cephalopod species has evolved up to 30 different ranges of patterns to hide in plain sight. This group of soft-bodied mollusks have skin covered in millions of pixel-like cells called chromatophores: pigment-filled sacs each surrounded by their own small muscle fiber. These muscles can stretch the chromatophore to flood with color or contract and shrink to a dot, creating varied, complex patterns. Octopuses and cuttlefish are also covered in small bumps, flaps, branches, and ridges called papillae, which can be ruffled upwards or smoothed out to create different skin textures too.\n\nThe common day octopus (Octopus cyanea) can become almost see-through beige and white on flat sandy surfaces; dark, mottled, and rugged on bumpy rocks; and flashes orange, red, and brown spikes along corals. Cuttlefish sometimes clump up, shrivel, and hide their arms to look like a tuft of algae, and baby giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama) hiding among seaweeds have been recorded sending waves of shaded dark brownish-green pigments across their body to copy the motion of swaying seaweed.\n\nWhile these shapeshifting skills certainly come in handy for inconspicuous disguises, there are many other reasons octopuses and other cephalopods change their skin\u2014and they may surprise you. Sometimes cephalopods need to do the opposite of blending in to escape a predator. If they\u2019ve been caught while in camouflage, many octopus species can turn their bodies dark and cloudy, darken their eyes, stretch out their body and arms to look bigger and stand taller. Cuttlefish even create eye-like shapes on their mantle \u2014 their sack-shaped body \u2014 back to stare down their predator. Predators learn to associate the highly venomous blue-ringed octopuses with the gaudy rings of indigo they flash across their yellow skin to alert predators they\u2019re not to be messed with.\n\nMeanwhile, the less-dangerous mimic octopuses (Thaumoctopus mimicus) impersonate all sorts of animals that are more threatening or venomous than they are. Among many other disguises, they can spread out their arms and display white and brown stripes to look like the sharp-spined, highly venomous lionfish. Mimicking other animals also helps cephalopods to appear less threatening and get close to their prey. Pharaoh cuttlefish (Sepia pharaonis) have been seen using their color, texture, and movement to appear as docile hermit crabs to their prey, the tropical damselfish. Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioide) swim in reverse and wave their arms like fins to look like herbivorous parrotfish, also to get close to their prey.\n\nCephalopods can also send stripes, circles, and patterns of color across their body as if to bamboozle their prey before striking. Martin How, an ecology of vision researcher at the University of Bristol, studies how Broadclub cuttlefish (Sepia latimanus) ripple dramatic dark rings of color from their head to their arms as they get closer to their prey. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a magician trying to mesmerize, or hypnotize their audience,\u201d he says, theorizing this helps the cuttlefish is disguise its approach, looking farther than it is, to catch the prey off guard.\n\nThe tropical octopus (Octopus laqueus) has also been spotted pulsing dark patterns to make an inverse illusion\u2014appearing to be moving forward while it remains still, tricking the prey into moving out of a hiding spot, according to How. This has been reported in other species of octopuses too. \u201cFor decades we've been studying camouflage as a static thing,\u201d says How. \u201cBut actually, once you actually can make a moving pattern on your body, you can do all kinds of really interesting things.\u201d\n\nSocial Humbolt squids (Dosidicus gigas) found a way to communicate by appearance even in the depths of the ocean where there\u2019s little sunlight.

Then it\u2019s time to share some love for native bees that pollinate many of our favorite foods.\u00a0 Say bee, and most picture a European honeybee\u2014a non-native species used in commercial honey production worldwide. But what gets easily forgotten is that North America is home to around 4,000 species of wild bees. To recognize these crucial ecosystem helpers, which provide 75 percent of our global food crop, the United Nations declared May 20 as World Bee Day in 2014. These diverse insects vary greatly in size, from the Sonoran Desert\u2019s tiny Perdita minima, about the size of a crayon tip, to inch-long carpenter bees, which pollinate popular foods such as tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. About 70 percent of U.S. native bees nest in the ground, not in hives, which also contributes to their relative anonymity. About a quarter of\u00a0U.S. native bees are endangered due to pesticides, climate change, and habitat loss. In 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service deemed seven yellow-faced bees in the Hylaeus\u00a0genus as endangered\u2014the first bees ever on the list. (See seven intimate pictures that reveal the beauty of bees.) The heartening news is, from home gardeners to academics, people are finding clever ways to help and study native pollinators. Here are four intriguing examples. Ages 7-12 In the mountains of California\u2019s Yosemite National Park, independent researcher and author Olivia Messinger Carril studies bees that live above 10,000 feet, including various species of mason, bumble, and mining bees.\u00a0 Her goal is to get a rough baseline of these alpine populations \u201cbefore climate change switches up the dynamics, so we can better understand changes we see moving forward,\u201d Carril says.\u00a0 Warming temperatures and drought in the region are damaging some ecosystems, for instance by fueling bigger wildfires and killing off vital tree species, according to the U.S. National Park Service. By capturing high-altitude bee species and cataloging where they were found, their location, and nearby plants, Carril is piecing together a picture of these pollinators\u2019 lifestyles. (Learn about threats to bees and why we\u2019re seeing fewer of them.) Carril also hopes to analyze environmental DNA, or DNA left behind by living things, in Yosemite. By extracting DNA on a flower, Carril says, \u201cyou know it was visited by three species of Bombus [a genus of bumblebee] and one species of mason bee.\u201d These details give researchers \u201ca sense of who has been in the area, even if we don\u2019t see them directly,\u201d she says. Standard beehives for European honeybees haven\u2019t changed much since their advent in 1851, which is why they have issues such as ventilation, insulation, and other insects getting in. With this in mind, graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture developed individual projects to build better honeybee hives or homes for Texas\u2019 native bees. It's an example of \u201cnew designers taking a look at an old problem,\u201d says Chris Graves, chief creative officer at Team One, which collaborated on \u00a0the project with the Healthy Hive Foundation and the architecture school. Some students were \u201cthoughtful about the native plants that would be part of the package,\u201d says Danelle Briscoe, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture who has a background in bringing native plants into her work.\u00a0 Student Ji Yoon Ahn created the \u201cLive, Work, Nest\u201d design, which looks like a funky flowerpot on a tripod. The circular wooden structure can house 120 native bees of various species. Native plants growing on the \u201croof\u201d provides easy access to food sources\u2014like having a caf\u00e9 in your apartment building. The portable design could be installed in urban areas, providing \u201ca dose of healthy ecology that urban environments often need, much the way humans need daily vitamins,\u201d Briscoe says. Overall, the UT bee project\u00a0addresses both scarcity of food for native bees and a \u201cpressing lack of habitat in some of our urban environments,\u201d she says. Planet Bee Foundation, a nonprofit based in San Francisco, works with numerous corporate partners to fund programs for schools, workplaces, and communities to spread the message of protecting native bees. \u201cWe have a flow going from these corporate partners to the schools that really need the resources,\u201d says Jason Graham, Planet Bee\u2019s lead scientist and entomologist. In one initiative, Planet Bee gifts a classroom with several native bee houses, which the children set up outside and monitor with help from Planet Bee staff. In some cases, solitary bee species move in, co-existing in the bee house. (Read nine ways you can help bees and other pollinators at home.) \u201cThe kids are going to be a next generation to really champion native bees,\u201d he says. We shouldn\u2019t \u201crely on just one species of bee for all of our agriculture.\u201d The nonprofit also offers corporate workshops, such as virtual honey tastings or field trips to look for pollinators. Fees for the program go to boosting school initiatives. People don\u2019t often think of bees or insects, alongside bigger animals, as wildlife, says Rich Hatfield, senior conservation biologist at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. When it comes to surveying native bee populations, we're \"decades behind where we are with birds and mammals,\u201d he says. (Read more about why we should care about native bees.) To fill that gap, Xerces began inviting the public to send in their own bumblebee observations through their website, newsletters, and social media. Over the past six years, that has amounted to 65,000 sightings across 35 species\u2014data that built the Bumble Bee Atlas, a collaborative effort to track and conserve native bumblebees, many of which are declining. The U.S. government listed the rusty patched bumblebee as federally endangered in 2017. \u201cThese have been wildly successful projects in terms of engaging thousands of people and collecting real data that's being utilized in many ways,\u201d Hatfield says.

        "title": "We finally know how cockroaches conquered the world",
        "text": "A new study traces the German cockroach\u2019s evolution throughout human history, from the Islamic empires to modern-day Europe. If you\u2019ve ever gotten up for a midnight snack and flicked on the kitchen light only to discover an army of shiny brown insects zipping beneath your fridge, then you already know the German cockroach. Despite their name, German cockroaches now inhabit every continent except Antarctica. In fact, scientists consider the species, Blattella germanica, to be the most prevalent of the 4,600 cockroach species on Earth. Which is surprising, given that the animals were basically unknown in Europe until Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1767. That and the fact that they have no close relatives there, nor does the species exist in the wild. So how did everyone\u2019s least favorite houseguest become a pest of global infamy? According to a new study, the answer is written in the German cockroach\u2019s DNA. By analyzing genome-wide markers of 281 cockroaches from 17 countries across six continents and measuring how closely those animals were related, scientists have for the first time traced the German cockroach\u2019s rapid rise and spread. All signs point to the species evolving from the Asian cockroach (Blattella asahinai) about 2,100 years ago in what is now India and Myanmar. As the species apparently abandoned the wild for a life spent in the shadow of humans, German cockroaches appear to have arrived in the Middle East around 1,200 years ago\u2014probably because of increased trade and military movements in the Islamic Umayyad or Abbasid caliphates, empires that once stretched from northern Africa to western Asia. German cockroaches experienced another geographic leap when, about 390 years ago, colonial activities kicked into overdrive and the roaches found their way to Europe and, later, the rest of the world\u2014thanks to improvements in transportation, the reach of European trade, and the advent of household heating, which allows the insects to survive the cold. To be clear, all these movements and migrations would have been unwittingly aided by people. (Read how cockroaches have neighborhoods, too.) \u201cThe German cockroach can\u2019t even fly,\u201d says Qian Tang, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University and lead author of the study published May 20 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cThey hitchhike in human vessels around the world.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t just dumb luck that allowed the cockroaches to succeed. Rather, it was the species\u2019 unparalleled ability to adapt and evolve\u2014something scientists are still trying to understand today, in the hopes that we might one day learn how to stop the German cockroach\u2019s march across the planet. To get a sense of just how much German cockroaches have changed over the last two millennia, all you need to do is put them side by side with their closest living relative, the Asian cockroach. For while the two species are still nearly identical, they couldn\u2019t be more different in behavior. Asian cockroaches fly toward light sources, while German cockroaches scurry away, says Chow-Yang Lee, an urban entomologist at the University of California, Riverside. Likewise, if you toss the two species into the air, the Asian roaches take wing, while German cockroaches hit the ground running, he says. \u201cWe have long suspected that the Asian cockroach is actually the ancestor for the German cockroach, but this paper pretty much nails it,\u201d says Lee, who was not affiliated with the new study. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely exciting.\u201d The study also revealed that German cockroach genetics reflect human relationships. For instance, German cockroaches in Singapore and Australia are actually more closely related to their cousins in the U.S. than other German cockroach populations in nearby Indonesia. This is likely because the U.S. has historically had more trade with Singapore and Australia than Indonesia. (Read how bugs and spiders keep New York City clean by eating trash.) \u201cIt's a beautiful example of the link between human activities, commerce, wars, colonization, and the spread of a well-adapted domiciliary pest,\u201d study co-author Coby Schal, an urban entomologist and cockroach expert at North Carolina State University, said by email. German cockroaches outcompete other cockroaches everywhere they go, says Tang. One reason for the species\u2019 success is a faster reproductive rate than most other cockroach species, he says, which allows the animals to rapidly develop resistance to pesticides. Earlier work by Schal\u2019s lab revealed that after years of luring cockroaches to eat glucose-soaked poison, the population that survived sugary baits yielded a new breed of cockroaches that rejected sweets altogether. (Learn more why pesticides only make cockroaches stronger.) \u201cIt\u2019s just unthinkable,\u201d says Lee. \u201cGlucose is such an important metabolic fuel for all organisms.\u201d Lee says sometimes he and his colleagues will be working on a new, anti-roach compound that hasn\u2019t even been released for commercial use yet, but by the time they test it on cockroaches in a lab, the animals are already resistant. And that, combined with the wonders of modern transportation, lead him to have very little hope that humans will find a way to beat back cockroach infestations anytime soon. \u201cIf you ask me to name one species or organism that I respect the most, it\u2019s probably the German cockroach,\u201d Lee says.

For instance, German cockroaches in Singapore and Australia are actually more closely related to their cousins in the U.S. than other German cockroach populations in nearby Indonesia. This is likely because the U.S. has historically had more trade with Singapore and Australia than Indonesia.\n\n\u201cIt's a beautiful example of the link between human activities, commerce, wars, colonization, and the spread of a well-adapted domiciliary pest,\u201d study co-author Coby Schal, an urban entomologist and cockroach expert at North Carolina State University, said by email. German cockroaches outcompete other cockroaches everywhere they go, says Tang. One reason for the species\u2019 success is a faster reproductive rate than most other cockroach species, he says, which allows the animals to rapidly develop resistance to pesticides.\n\nEarlier work by Schal\u2019s lab revealed that after years of luring cockroaches to eat glucose-soaked poison, the population that survived sugary baits yielded a new breed of cockroaches that rejected sweets altogether. \u201cIt\u2019s just unthinkable,\u201d says Lee. \u201cGlucose is such an important metabolic fuel for all organisms.\u201d Lee says sometimes he and his colleagues will be working on a new, anti-roach compound that hasn\u2019t even been released for commercial use yet, but by the time they test it on cockroaches in a lab, the animals are already resistant. And that, combined with the wonders of modern transportation, lead him to have very little hope that humans will find a way to beat back cockroach infestations anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me to name one species or organism that I respect the most, it\u2019s probably the German cockroach,\u201d Lee says."

Ages 7-12 Here\u2019s how these Young Explorers are helping to show that the entire natural world merits protecting. A lunchroom poster at her high school in Colombia sparked C\u00e1rol Sierra Dur\u00e1n\u2019s interest in bats. \u201cI realized I was 17, and I had never seen the face of a bat before,\u201d she says. At first, Dur\u00e1n thought that her ignorance was unusual. Once she realized how little even many scientists knew about the basic biology of bats, Dur\u00e1n was hooked. \u201cMost people, when I tell them that I work with bats, their reaction is a weird face. Of all the animals in the world, why would I choose to work with these weird, nocturnal creatures?\u201d says Dur\u00e1n. \u201cSo the first conversation is amazing because you see their faces change.\u201d (Why bats are the real superheroes of the animal world.) Dur\u00e1n found that explaining bats' prodigious insect-eating abilities boosted buy-in from local communities. Bats, she told farmers, are a natural form of pest control that can\u2019t be replicated\u2014even with the most expensive insecticides. For her master\u2019s degree research at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and her National Geographic project, Dur\u00e1n surveyed the types of insect-eating bats that frequented Mexico\u2019s rice fields, such as gray sac-winged bats,\u00a0as well as calculated the economic value of the ecosystem services they provided. Dur\u00e1n is continuing her work as a Ph.D. student to understand the farming practices that promote bat health. Like many Kenyan Maasai boys, Richard Turere began helping to protect his family\u2019s livestock from nearby rhinos, lions, and cheetahs when he was just 9. Many locals, including his father, used lethal methods to deter predators from their livestock. Turere wanted to avoid harming lions, which are declining and considered vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. So he tried everything from kerosene lamps to scarecrows, but the felines quickly learned that these were harmless. The only thing that worked was regular patrols with a flashlight after dark. After dismantling some discarded household electronics, Turere built his first Lion Light by connecting some LED bulbs to car indicator flashers. The current iteration involves a series of randomly flashing smartphone-size lights powered by a solar panel. The constantly changing pattern of flashes tricks the lions into thinking there\u2019s a person there. (Read more about the challenges of living with lions.) \u201cAt first, everyone thought I was crazy because I was just a kid and I was always walking around with wires,\u201d Turere says. \u201cNow they see Lion Lights as something that helps keep their animals safe.\u201d Turere, who became a National Geographic Young Explorer in 2020, recently graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree from the African Leadership University. He's now building up teams of Lion Light ambassadors to help educate communities about the lights and the importance of conservation, including in neighboring countries. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see this project grow and spread through my community and across Africa,\u201d he says. As soon as Deborah Santos de Azevedo tells people she researches sharks, she\u2019s asked if she\u2019s ever been bitten. \u201cNot even close,\u201d she laughs.

Instead, the aquarium said she was the first round stingray to display parthenogenesis, or reproduction without fertilization of an egg.\u00a0 Common among many small invertebrates and fish, this method of asexual reproduction has been documented in more than 80 species. (How some animals have \u2018virgin births\u2019: Parthenogenesis explained.) An enlarged uterus, cystic ovaries, and unovulated eggs are hallmarks of reproductive disease, according to the Morris Animal Foundation.

In the wild, females attract males by emitting positive electrical fields from both a respiratory opening called a spiracle behind each eye and other points on their bodies.

The bright red capital letters, plastered alongside photographs of toothy sharks, are meant to warn people that sightings of great white sharks have increased along the New England coast in recent years. The predators, which can grow up to 18 feet (5.5 m) long, are attracted to gray seals, a species that has bounced back along the U.S. East Coast since the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act banned hunting of the species in 1972. The recovery of shark prey species, coupled with an increase in beach tourism worldwide, have contributed to a gradual rise in shark bites around the globe since 1970, according to data collected by the International Shark Attack File, a database run by the Florida Museum of Natural History. But in recent years those numbers appear to be declining: There were 57 unprovoked shark bites globally in 2020, down from 66 in 2018. Ten of the bites in 2020 were fatal; although this represents a sharp increase from the average of four fatalities a year, experts say the relatively high number is likely an anomaly. Even still, shark encounters are extremely rare, and when they do happen, sharks almost always bite people by mistake, thinking they\u2019re a seal or another prey. Swimming is riskier if you\u2019re sharing the waters with a shark\u2019s natural food source. Cape Cod and Cape Town, South Africa, are \u201cthe only two places in the world where you have a high density of people, seals, and great white sharks\u201d swimming together close to shore, says Christopher Pepin-Neff, a social scientist at the University of Sydney who studies how the public perceives sharks. Though shark bites generate a lot of press, only three shark species account for most unprovoked bites of humans: great whites, tiger sharks, and bull sharks. Sharks have gotten a publicity boost in recent years, as emerging research shifts the narrative from a senseless killer to an animal that can form friendships and live for 400 years. And we know how important sharks\u2014as keystone species that play vital roles in maintaining ocean ecosystems\u2014are to the ocean\u2019s health. Ages 7-12 Shark researchers and educators are trying to help the public better understand how sharks behave\u2014and the public seems receptive. Some researchers have suggested replacing the term \u201cshark attacks\u201d with \u201cshark bites,\u201d or more broadly, \u201cshark encounters,\u201d the Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2021. For instance, up to a third of shark run-ins don\u2019t cause injury, such as when a person steps on a small, bottom-dwelling shark, the paper said. On Cape Cod, the Atlantic Shark Center, a museum run by the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, has seen an increase of about 3,000 visitors each year since opening in 2016 (with the exception of 2020, because of decreased tourism during the pandemic), says Marianne Long, the conservancy\u2019s education director. \u201cThe number one question that we get when people come in to see us is, \u2018What beach do I have to go to to see a shark?\u2019\u201d adds Long. Building on that curiosity about sharks by engaging people with a narrative, experts say, may be exactly what we need to both communicate the risks and safely share our oceans with these impressive animals. What if the daily weather forecast told us when our favorite beach might be particularly sharky? This isn\u2019t as improbable as it might sound. The National Geographic show Sky Sharks: Closer Than You Think portrays how drones have revolutionized shark science and are helping researchers track the movements of sharks as they travel close to shore. These aerial views\u2014along with analyses of factors like water temperature, the presence of predators, and whether the sharks are young or pregnant\u2014can help us understand much more clearly when and why sharks come so close to swimmers. Following the research of scientist Chris Lowe, director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, the show investigates seasonal surges in sightings of great white sharks along the coast of Southern California. Drone footage off the coast of Santa Barbara shows sharks coming within feet of swimmers and gliding beneath surfboards without being detected. The sharks are nearly all babies sheltering in the shallower waters, one hypothesis being that they\u2019re safer there from predators: orcas or adult great white sharks. Meanwhile, a little farther south in San Diego, the dozens of regular leopard shark visitors are mostly pregnant. Like hens incubating their eggs, these mothers-to-be were possibly lured by the warmer water. The findings are scientifically compelling and have a practical application as well. Understanding the conditions that make for sharky waters could help the public be much better informed about whether a trip to the beach might call for extra precautions. Beachgoers are accustomed to alerts about rip tides or approaching storms; why not a heads-up about sharks? \u201cOnce we understand the formula that attracts sharks,\u201d says showrunner Jennie Hammond, \u201cthen we can get one step ahead and predict where they\u2019re going to show up.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The National Geographic show Sky Sharks: Closer Than You Think portrays how drones have revolutionized shark science and are helping researchers track the movements of sharks as they travel close to shore. These aerial views\u2014along with analyses of factors like water temperature, the presence of predators, and whether the sharks are young or pregnant\u2014can help us understand much more clearly when and why sharks come so close to swimmers. Following the research of scientist Chris Lowe, director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, the show investigates seasonal surges in sightings of great white sharks along the coast of Southern California. Drone footage off the coast of Santa Barbara shows sharks coming within feet of swimmers and gliding beneath surfboards without being detected. The sharks are nearly all babies sheltering in the shallower waters, one hypothesis being that they\u2019re safer there from predators: orcas or adult great white sharks. Meanwhile, a little farther south in San Diego, the dozens of regular leopard shark visitors are mostly pregnant. Like hens incubating their eggs, these mothers-to-be were possibly lured by the warmer water. The findings are scientifically compelling and have a practical application as well. Understanding the conditions that make for sharky waters could help the public be much better informed about whether a trip to the beach might call for extra precautions. Beachgoers are accustomed to alerts about rip tides or approaching storms; why not a heads-up about sharks? \u201cOnce we understand the formula that attracts sharks,\u201d says showrunner Jennie Hammond, \u201cthen we can get one step ahead and predict where they\u2019re going to show up.\u201d"

        "title": "Sea turtles are surviving\u2014despite us",
        "text": "These reptiles have roamed the oceans for 100 million years. We've put them at risk, but with a little help, they're rebounding. To see all that\u2019s hopeful and appalling about the way we treat sea turtles, there\u2019s no better place to start than the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel. This shimmering tower of blue and white glass is shaped like the jib of a sailboat bound for shore. It rose two decades ago on an artificial island amid the steel forest of construction cranes that is Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates. A royal suite, at 8,396 square feet, comes with a private cinema and 17 pillow options. A weekend stay can top $50,000. I have come here, though, to see its nonpaying guests. Passing a fleet of white Rolls-Royces, I meet British expat marine biologist David Robinson. We take an elevator down to a parking garage and walk by Lamborghinis to our destination: a labyrinth of pipes and plastic pools, the intensive care unit of an elaborate marine turtle hospital. In one tub a green sea turtle struggles with internal organ damage. One floor up, sick, critically endangered hawksbills fill aquariums. The hotel housing this rehab center is owned by a holding group whose driving force is Dubai\u2019s emir. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the architect of the region\u2019s lightning growth, wants his city to become a model of environmental stewardship. But the reptilian miseries unspooling in this epicenter of consumption reveal much about the ills we humans heap on these creatures. Workers here have seen turtles with balloons lodged in their intestines, turtles with flippers broken after getting caught in fishing nets, a turtle bashed in the head and tossed off a boat. One female green turtle was struck by a ship just down the road, near the world\u2019s ninth busiest seaport. The impact crushed her shell, carving out a jagged three-pound wedge as big as an iron. \u201cPeople are doing this,\u201d says Robinson, a former operations manager for this facility. \u201cEverything\u2014every aspect, every single species of turtle, every threat that they face\u2014is anthropogenic.\u201d He certainly doesn\u2019t mean just here. From Kemp\u2019s ridleys no bigger than car tires to leatherbacks that can outweigh polar bears, six of the world\u2019s seven sea turtle species are considered vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. The status of the seventh, the flatback of Australia, is unknown. And yet these beasts soldier on, despite the obstacles we place before them. Of the sea turtle nesting colonies that were reviewed in a recent analysis, more than twice as many were increasing as were trending downward. Scientists this year found that turtle populations protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act were on the upswing. Hawaii\u2019s green turtles, long in trouble, are rebounding far faster than anyone expected. One turtle released from Robinson\u2019s care after 546 days of treatment for a head injury made the longest documented journey by a green sea turtle. She traveled 5,146 miles, from the Middle East nearly to Thailand, before her tracking device finally gave out. Ages 7-12 Sea turtles, it appears, may be more resilient than once thought. \u201cI\u2019ve seen all sorts of crazy injuries, deformities, illnesses, and they just keep going,\u201d says Bryan Wallace, who oversees sea turtle assessments for the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN. \u201cWhere\u2019s the dodo or the passenger pigeon of the sea turtle world?\u201d While a few local stocks are in real danger of blinking out\u2014Malaysian leatherbacks, for example\u2014all seven species are hanging on regionally and globally. As we\u2019ve plundered the seas, built up coastlines, and set about heating the planet, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether we\u2019re dooming these animals. But after months of reporting on sea turtles in several countries, I think we should consider another query instead: How might these reptiles fare with a bit more help? Spend enough time watching sea turtles and it\u2019s hard to escape how astonishing they are. They soar through oceans with winglike front flippers, dig nests using back appendages that scoop and toss sand almost like hands, and squeeze salt water, like tears, from glands near their eyes. Their mouths are similar to bird beaks, perhaps because turtles share a common ancestor with chickens. All but leatherbacks, with their layer of thick skin, have bony external skeletons covered in scutes of keratin, the material found in rhinoceros horns and our own fingernails. But each species is different. Hawksbills help reefs by eating sponges that can smother coral. Loggerheads use powerful jaws to crush horseshoe crabs. Leatherbacks feed on jellyfish and sea squirts and can easily migrate from Japan to California. Marine turtles split from their terrestrial relatives more than 100 million years ago. They survived the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs and squeaked past a marine extinction two million years ago that cut their numbers almost in half. Today sea turtles are found on the beaches of every continent except Antarctica, and they swim in all tropical and temperate waters. Perhaps their ubiquity explains the many roles they\u2019ve played for people. They tell our stories: In Chinese mythology, sea turtle legs hold up the sky. We turn to them for healing: Turtle meat in West Africa was once believed to fight leprosy, and bathing in a broth of loggerhead plastron, the bony undershell, was considered a tonic for lung ailments. Even today, bones and scutes are sold as medicine from China to Mexico. Through most of this shared history, turtles haven\u2019t just survived\u2014they\u2019ve thrived. \u201cThe sea was all thick with them, and they were of the very largest, so numerous that it seemed that the ships would run aground on them,\u201d a Spanish priest wrote of Christopher Columbus\u2019s view of Cuba\u2019s sea turtles in 1494, during his second voyage. Some scientists today believe the pre-Columbian Caribbean alone may have been home to 91 million adult green turtles. That\u2019s roughly 10 times as many as all the adult sea turtles of every species believed to be alive today. So many occupied the Cayman Islands in the 1700s that English settlers used them to supply Jamaica with meat. It wasn\u2019t long before West Indies turtles were being served in London pubs and John Adams was slurping sea turtle soup during the First Continental Congress. Within a century, though, Caribbean turtle populations had crashed, sending turtle hunters to new coastlines, foreshadowing a great transition. The rain is just starting on a dark Costa Rican night when Helen Pheasey and I cut across a beach with a red flashlight. Pheasey, a Ph.D. candidate who studies the black market trade in reptiles, is working with a U.S.-based conservation outfit called Paso Pac\u00edfico. In her pocket she carries a fake turtle egg implanted with a GPS transmitter, and we\u2019re looking for its potential mom. She gestures toward an olive ridley, alone and kicking up sand in the dark. As the pregnant turtle drops her eggs, Pheasey crawls toward the turtle\u2019s tail, reaches into the mound of Ping-Pong ball\u2013size eggs, and places the decoy in the middle of the pile. She\u2019s hoping hurried egg poachers will nab her fake along with their intended loot. Turtle eggs are hot commodities in parts of Asia and Latin America. They may be boiled in soup, cooked into omelets, or dropped raw into a shot glass with lemon, tomato juice, and pepper. Eggs don\u2019t bring huge dollars, but because most turtles lay 50 to 100 or more at once and leave long sandy tracks from sea to nest, they\u2019re easy to find and steal in volume. In most countries, selling turtle eggs has been illegal for years. Yet in 2018, police seized a pickup in Oaxaca, Mexico, loaded with garbage bags stuffed with 22,000 turtle eggs. Malaysian authorities two years earlier intercepted four Filipinos in wooden boats carrying 19,000 eggs. The $7,400 those sailors stood to make was nearly three times the average yearly wage in their community. Egg theft is often linked with poverty or drug and alcohol abuse, Pheasey says. But the hope is that fake eggs could help stop organized traffickers. On a recent Saturday near Guanacaste, Costa Rica, thieves raided 28 nests\u2014a haul that included one of Pheasey\u2019s fake eggs. At 7 a.m. Monday, Pheasey watched on smartphone apps as her egg traveled from the peninsula to the back of a building on the mainland. After a delay, the egg moved again, to a neighborhood in San Ram\u00f3n, 85 miles from the beach. Pheasey traced the route in her car. The egg had stopped at a supermarket loading dock. There it probably changed hands before being ferried to someone\u2019s house. Pheasey and Paso Pac\u00edfico are still working out kinks in their tactics, but even if the decoy eggs show promise in fighting smugglers, that\u2019s just one of the many problems turtles face. We\u2019re chewing up nesting beaches by erecting oceanfront skyscrapers, hotels, and subdivisions. We\u2019ve illuminated coastlines with disorienting streetlights. When turtles manage to find sand in which to lay eggs, bright lights often send them wandering. Some get hit by cars. Pollution, from oily toxics to plastics, spills into coastal waters. Straws and plastic forks get sucked up turtles\u2019 noses. Hungry leatherbacks mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. New research suggests that nine million hawksbills were slaughtered in the past 150 years, mostly for their fiery red and gold carapaces, which were fashioned into hair clips, eyeglasses, jewelry boxes, and furniture. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) began banning the sale of turtle goods in the 1970s, but that hasn\u2019t always worked. In 2012, researchers found thousands of hawksbill pieces for sale in Japan and China. Solid numbers are unavailable, but scientists estimate that only 60,000 to 80,000 nesting female hawksbills remain worldwide. Meanwhile some countries still allow subsistence hunts for turtle meat. But even in countries where that practice has been outlawed, bans are meaningless without enforcement, buy-in from local residents, and alternatives for food or income. In Mozambique and Madagascar alone, for example, tens of thousands\u2014perhaps hundreds of thousands\u2014of both young and adult green turtles are illegally killed each year by hunters. There has been some promise in places where residents have bought in to the idea of turtle conservation. One morning in Costa Rica I sit in a delivery truck as the ocean flickers through the royal palms. Our payload: 80 large bags filled with 96,000 turtle eggs. A few miles down the road, we back up to an open shed. Men unload this delicate cargo onto a sorting table, where women begin placing the eggs in smaller bags. Soon they\u2019ll be repackaged and sold to restaurants and bars as far away as the capital, San Jos\u00e9. Here it\u2019s all perfectly legal\u2014and may even help turtles. Every month this beach in Ostional, on Costa Rica\u2019s upper Pacific Coast peninsula, is the site of one of the world\u2019s largest mass-nesting events. Known as an arribada, it typically begins in the dark, as it did this morning. Female olive ridleys by the thousands congregate offshore, their forms silhouetted by the starry sky. Then, following some mysterious cue, they start crashing ashore. They come in waves, bumping and pushing past one another, oblivious to the threats around them: egg-scavenging vultures, wild dogs, hungry raccoons. Then they start digging, uncovering and crushing each other\u2019s eggs, filling the new holes with future offspring before lumbering back to sea. The humans arrive at dawn. Barefoot men perform an odd step dance, bouncing gingerly heel to toe, feeling for loose earth with their feet. Finding some, they squat and dig until they reach eggs. Then teenagers and women begin filling bags. Ostional didn\u2019t really become much of a community until sometime after World War II. But by the 1970s, settlers had come to rely on turtles. Soil nearby wasn\u2019t great for farming, and there were few jobs, so residents plucked turtle eggs to feed their pigs. \u201cTurtles were no more special to us than our chickens,\u201d Maria Ruiz Avil\u00e9s says during a break from labeling egg bags. Costa Rica began trying to prohibit egg harvests in the 1970s, but enforcement was lax. Researchers eventually recommended an arrangement: a regulated, legal, domestic trade. So many turtles show up during an arribada that they dig far more nests than the beach can accommodate. Even without poaching, up to half of the eggs on the beach were being destroyed, mostly by other turtles. Costa Rica\u2019s national government allows the few hundred residents of Ostional to legally collect a portion of the eggs. Today Ostional\u2019s egg harvest is viewed by many as a success. Residents take a small number of eggs, and some biologists think ridding the beach of the excess keeps microbes from killing more. Sales pay for beach patrols and enforcement to keep poachers out. Paperwork follows every sale, so buyers know the eggs are legal. Invested residents drive off predators to help remaining hatchlings get to the sea. \u201cWe do a good job,\u201d Ruiz Avil\u00e9s says. That doesn\u2019t mean this model should be exported. Demand for eggs here is a fraction of what it is in, say, Mexico. And arribadas here offer an embarrassment of riches, because culling eggs may help more baby turtles survive. \u201cIn my opinion, Ostional should never ever be taken as an example for conservation anywhere else\u2014ever,\u201d says Costa Rican Rold\u00e1n Valverde, a professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. While some experts suggest this legal harvest prevents far more eggs from being taken illegally, others fear that legitimizing any of this trade perpetuates the black market. Unfortunately, we\u2019re stuck making decisions with imperfect information. In fact, it's often unclear how many sea turtles of each species remain\u2014or how many is enough to ensure their survival. New research suggests that some population counts based on nesting beaches may be far too generous. But nest counts can also underestimate turtle numbers. \u201cWe need to understand a lot more about what\u2019s happening in the water, where sea turtles spend 99 percent of their lives,\u201d says Nicolas Pilcher, a sea turtle biologist who does fieldwork for governments and nonprofits. Pilcher is piloting a boat across shallow seagrass beds about 50 miles west of Abu Dhabi. He\u2019s conducting a turtle rodeo, chasing a green turtle as it zigs and zags just below the water\u2019s surface. Near the bow Marina Antonopoulou, with Emirates Nature-World Wildlife Fund, perches on the gunwale. When Pilcher shouts the signal, she launches onto the carapace, trying to wrestle the turtle to the surface and into the boat. But it wriggles free. Antonopoulou stands in the water, frustrated but amused. Pilcher pushes on. Antonopoulou and a team of scientists, including some from the Abu Dhabi government, are cruising the U.A.E.\u2019s Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve to gauge where these speedsters are headed. Near Pilcher\u2019s feet a half dozen green turtles lounge. A quick surgical procedure will tell him whether these animals are male or female and ready to mate and nest. The team will attach tracking devices to some, then release them all. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to link where these turtles live, which is here, with where they lay their eggs,\u201d Pilcher says. That\u2019s key to saving turtles. But turtles often feed in waters controlled by one government and nest on beaches controlled by another. This is especially true in the Middle East, where U.A.E. turtles may lay eggs in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, or even Pakistan. Conservationists and the Abu Dhabi government can\u2019t negotiate with neighboring countries for more protection without knowing which turtles go where. That matters, of course, because development in the Middle East is booming, and \u201cnesting habitat for turtles is continually shrinking,\u201d Pilcher says. Sea turtle conservation has made great strides in recent decades in many places around the globe. In Florida and Hawaii, coastal resorts and hotels are reducing beachfront lighting. Use of devices that let unsuspecting turtles escape fishing nets helped save Kemp\u2019s ridleys in Mexico and loggerheads in the Atlantic and is being tried in other areas. We\u2019ve closed fisheries and changed commercial fishing hooks to prevent accidental snagging. A few fishing fleets employ observers who document turtle interactions. Still, even as we make progress, complex new challenges are emerging. The sex of turtles is determined by the temperature of the sand where eggs gestate. Warmer sands produce more females, so as climate change drives sand temperatures higher across the tropics, more turtles are being born female. On a warm evening in a San Diego, California, bay, I watch a crew of scientists hold an adult green turtle while Camryn Allen quickly draws a vial of blood. For several years Allen, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has used hormones such as testosterone to track the sex of sea turtles. Here the ratio of females to males has increased slightly, but her recent work in Australia truly alarmed her. Raine Island, a 52-acre half-moon of sand on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef, is the biggest nesting island on Earth for green sea turtles. More than 90 percent of the northern Great Barrier Reef\u2019s green turtles deposit eggs here and on nearby Moulter Cay. But Allen and her colleagues discovered that as temperatures have risen, female green turtles born on Raine have come to outnumber males 116 to one. \u201cSeeing those results scared the crap out of me,\u201d Allen says. It\u2019s not the only threat climate change poses. As hurricanes become more powerful, they\u2019re wiping out more turtle nests. Rising seas also are flooding nest sites and drowning eggs. And yet for all that, there are hopeful signs. Turtles didn\u2019t survive 100 million years without developing strategies to weather hard times. They can slow their metabolism and go months without eating. Some females have skipped nesting seasons for years, only to show up again a decade later. New research suggests males may mate with many females when populations are stretched thin. And sea turtles may switch nesting beaches in times of stress. Allen\u2019s initial fear has tapered off as she\u2019s seen turtles\u2019 versatility. \u201cWe may lose some smaller populations, but sea turtles are never going to go away completely,\u201d she says. \u201cI think turtles, out of all the other species, might actually have a pretty good shot.\u201d They just can\u2019t do it by themselves.

As the pregnant turtle drops her eggs, Pheasey crawls toward the turtle\u2019s tail, reaches into the mound of Ping-Pong ball\u2013size eggs, and places the decoy in the middle of the pile. She\u2019s hoping hurried egg poachers will nab her fake along with their intended loot. Turtle eggs are hot commodities in parts of Asia and Latin America. They may be boiled in soup, cooked into omelets, or dropped raw into a shot glass with lemon, tomato juice, and pepper. Eggs don\u2019t bring huge dollars, but because most turtles lay 50 to 100 or more at once and leave long sandy tracks from sea to nest, they\u2019re easy to find and steal in volume. In most countries, selling turtle eggs has been illegal for years. Yet in 2018, police seized a pickup in Oaxaca, Mexico, loaded with garbage bags stuffed with 22,000 turtle eggs. Malaysian authorities two years earlier intercepted four Filipinos in wooden boats carrying 19,000 eggs. The $7,400 those sailors stood to make was nearly three times the average yearly wage in their community. Egg theft is often linked with poverty or drug and alcohol abuse, Pheasey says. But the hope is that fake eggs could help stop organized traffickers. On a recent Saturday near Guanacaste, Costa Rica, thieves raided 28 nests\u2014a haul that included one of Pheasey\u2019s fake eggs. At 7 a.m. Monday, Pheasey watched on smartphone apps as her egg traveled from the peninsula to the back of a building on the mainland. After a delay, the egg moved again, to a neighborhood in San Ram\u00f3n, 85 miles from the beach. Pheasey traced the route in her car. The egg had stopped at a supermarket loading dock. There it probably changed hands before being ferried to someone\u2019s house. Pheasey and Paso Pac\u00edfico are still working out kinks in their tactics, but even if the decoy eggs show promise in fighting smugglers, that\u2019s just one of the many problems turtles face. We\u2019re chewing up nesting beaches by erecting oceanfront skyscrapers, hotels, and subdivisions. We\u2019ve illuminated coastlines with disorienting streetlights. When turtles manage to find sand in which to lay eggs, bright lights often send them wandering. Some get hit by cars. Pollution, from oily toxics to plastics, spills into coastal waters. Straws and plastic forks get sucked up turtles\u2019 noses. Hungry leatherbacks mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. New research suggests that nine million hawksbills were slaughtered in the past 150 years, mostly for their fiery red and gold carapaces, which were fashioned into hair clips, eyeglasses, jewelry boxes, and furniture. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) began banning the sale of turtle goods in the 1970s, but that hasn\u2019t always worked. In 2012, researchers found thousands of hawksbill pieces for sale in Japan and China. Solid numbers are unavailable, but scientists estimate that only 60,000 to 80,000 nesting female hawksbills remain worldwide. Meanwhile some countries still allow subsistence hunts for turtle meat. But even in countries where that practice has been outlawed, bans are meaningless without enforcement, buy-in from local residents, and alternatives for food or income. In Mozambique and Madagascar alone, for example, tens of thousands\u2014perhaps hundreds of thousands\u2014of both young and adult green turtles are illegally killed each year by hunters. There has been some promise in places where residents have bought in to the idea of turtle conservation. One morning in Costa Rica I sit in a delivery truck as the ocean flickers through the royal palms. Our payload: 80 large bags filled with 96,000 turtle eggs. A few miles down the road, we back up to an open shed. Men unload this delicate cargo onto a sorting table, where women begin placing the eggs in smaller bags. Soon they\u2019ll be repackaged and sold to restaurants and bars as far away as the capital, San Jos\u00e9. Here it\u2019s all perfectly legal\u2014and may even help turtles. Every month this beach in Ostional, on Costa Rica\u2019s upper Pacific Coast peninsula, is the site of one of the world\u2019s largest mass-nesting events. Known as an arribada, it typically begins in the dark, as it did this morning. Female olive ridleys by the thousands congregate offshore, their forms silhouetted by the starry sky. Then, following some mysterious cue, they start crashing ashore. They come in waves, bumping and pushing past one another, oblivious to the threats around them: egg-scavenging vultures, wild dogs, hungry raccoons. Then they start digging, uncovering and crushing each other\u2019s eggs, filling the new holes with future offspring before lumbering back to sea. The humans arrive at dawn. Barefoot men perform an odd step dance, bouncing gingerly heel to toe, feeling for loose earth with their feet. Finding some, they squat and dig until they reach eggs. Then teenagers and women begin filling bags. Ostional didn\u2019t really become much of a community until sometime after World War II. But by the 1970s, settlers had come to rely on turtles. Soil nearby wasn\u2019t great for farming, and there were few jobs, so residents plucked turtle eggs to feed their pigs. \u201cTurtles were no more special to us than our chickens,\u201d Maria Ruiz Avil\u00e9s says during a break from labeling egg bags. Costa Rica began trying to prohibit egg harvests in the 1970s, but enforcement was lax. Researchers eventually recommended an arrangement: a regulated, legal, domestic trade. So many turtles show up during an arribada that they dig far more nests than the beach can accommodate. Even without poaching, up to half of the eggs on the beach were being destroyed, mostly by other turtles. Costa Rica\u2019s national government allows the few hundred residents of Ostional to legally collect a portion of the eggs. Today Ostional\u2019s egg harvest is viewed by many as a success. Residents take a small number of eggs, and some biologists think ridding the beach of the excess keeps microbes from killing more. Sales pay for beach patrols and enforcement to keep poachers out. Paperwork follows every sale, so buyers know the eggs are legal. Invested residents drive off predators to help remaining hatchlings get to the sea. \u201cWe do a good job,\u201d Ruiz Avil\u00e9s says. That doesn\u2019t mean this model should be exported. Demand for eggs here is a fraction of what it is in, say, Mexico. And arribadas here offer an embarrassment of riches, because culling eggs may help more baby turtles survive. \u201cIn my opinion, Ostional should never ever be taken as an example for conservation anywhere else\u2014ever,\u201d says Costa Rican Rold\u00e1n Valverde, a professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. While some experts suggest this legal harvest prevents far more eggs from being taken illegally, others fear that legitimizing any of this trade perpetuates the black market. Unfortunately, we\u2019re stuck making decisions with imperfect information. In fact, it's often unclear how many sea turtles of each species remain\u2014or how many is enough to ensure their survival. New research suggests that some population counts based on nesting beaches may be far too generous. But nest counts can also underestimate turtle numbers. \u201cWe need to understand a lot more about what\u2019s happening in the water, where sea turtles spend 99 percent of their lives,\u201d says Nicolas Pilcher, a sea turtle biologist who does fieldwork for governments and nonprofits. Pilcher is piloting a boat across shallow seagrass beds about 50 miles west of Abu Dhabi. He\u2019s conducting a turtle rodeo, chasing a green turtle as it zigs and zags just below the water\u2019s surface. Near the bow Marina Antonopoulou, with Emirates Nature-World Wildlife Fund, perches on the gunwale. When Pilcher shouts the signal, she launches onto the carapace, trying to wrestle the turtle to the surface and into the boat. But it wriggles free. Antonopoulou stands in the water, frustrated but amused. Pilcher pushes on. Antonopoulou and a team of scientists, including some from the Abu Dhabi government, are cruising the U.A.E.\u2019s Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve to gauge where these speedsters are headed. Near Pilcher\u2019s feet a half dozen green turtles lounge. A quick surgical procedure will tell him whether these animals are male or female and ready to mate and nest. The team will attach tracking devices to some, then release them all. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to link where these turtles live, which is here, with where they lay their eggs,\u201d Pilcher says. That\u2019s key to saving turtles. But turtles often feed in waters controlled by one government and nest on beaches controlled by another. This is especially true in the Middle East, where U.A.E. turtles may lay eggs in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, or even Pakistan. Conservationists and the Abu Dhabi government can\u2019t negotiate with neighboring countries for more protection without knowing which turtles go where. That matters, of course, because development in the Middle East is booming, and \u201cnesting habitat for turtles is continually shrinking,\u201d Pilcher says. Sea turtle conservation has made great strides in recent decades in many places around the globe. In Florida and Hawaii, coastal resorts and hotels are reducing beachfront lighting. Use of devices that let unsuspecting turtles escape fishing nets helped save Kemp\u2019s ridleys in Mexico and loggerheads in the Atlantic and is being tried in other areas. We\u2019ve closed fisheries and changed commercial fishing hooks to prevent accidental snagging. A few fishing fleets employ observers who document turtle interactions. Still, even as we make progress, complex new challenges are emerging. The sex of turtles is determined by the temperature of the sand where eggs gestate. Warmer sands produce more females, so as climate change drives sand temperatures higher across the tropics, more turtles are being born female. On a warm evening in a San Diego, California, bay, I watch a crew of scientists hold an adult green turtle while Camryn Allen quickly draws a vial of blood. For several years Allen, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has used hormones such as testosterone to track the sex of sea turtles. Here the ratio of females to males has increased slightly, but her recent work in Australia truly alarmed her. Raine Island, a 52-acre half-moon of sand on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef, is the biggest nesting island on Earth for green sea turtles. More than 90 percent of the northern Great Barrier Reef\u2019s green turtles deposit eggs here and on nearby Moulter Cay. But Allen and her colleagues discovered that as temperatures have risen, female green turtles born on Raine have come to outnumber males 116 to one. \u201cSeeing those results scared the crap out of me,\u201d Allen says. It\u2019s not the only threat climate change poses. As hurricanes become more powerful, they\u2019re wiping out more turtle nests. Rising seas also are flooding nest sites and drowning eggs. And yet for all that, there are hopeful signs. Turtles didn\u2019t survive 100 million years without developing strategies to weather hard times. They can slow their metabolism and go months without eating. Some females have skipped nesting seasons for years, only to show up again a decade later. New research suggests males may mate with many females when populations are stretched thin. And sea turtles may switch nesting beaches in times of stress. Allen\u2019s initial fear has tapered off as she\u2019s seen turtles\u2019 versatility. \u201cWe may lose some smaller populations, but sea turtles are never going to go away completely,\u201d she says. \u201cI think turtles, out of all the other species, might actually have a pretty good shot.\u201d They just can\u2019t do it by themselves."

        "text": "The land hermit crab Coenobita brevimanus is native to Indonesia.  There are over 800 species of hermit crabs worldwide, and almost all are ocean dwellers\u2014though people are likely most familiar with the dozen semi-terrestrial species, called land hermit crabs, which are often kept as pets. There\u2019s only one freshwater hermit crab, Clibanarius fonticola, which is native to Vanuatu. Hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers, eating microscopic mussels and clams, bits of dead animals, and macroalgae. These crustaceans have been misnamed for two reasons: First, they\u2019re not true crabs, like blue crabs, in that they don\u2019t have a uniformly hard exoskeleton and can\u2019t grow their own shells. Instead, hermit crabs have a hard exoskeleton on the front part of their bodies but a soft tail on the other half, which they protect using the discarded shells of other animals, like whelks. They\u2019re more closely related to certain kinds of lobsters than to true crabs. Hermit crabs have a curled tail with a hook that enables their bodies to fit inside these borrowed shells. Sometimes when a new shell turns up, hermit crabs will form a line, biggest to smallest, to see which animal fits the new shell. The next smallest will take that crab\u2019s hand-me-down home, and so on. A Pacific red hermit crab, Elassochirus gilli, (left) and white hermit crab, Elassochirus tenuimanus, at the Alaska SeaLife Center. This behavior of sheltering in shells alone is actually what gives them their name. But hermit crab is a misnomer for these social crabs, which sometimes live in large groups of a hundred or more in the wild. Hermit crabs vary in their mating habits. The Caribbean hermit crab, for example, lives in wetlands, but when it\u2019s time to mate, will head for the seashore in huge masses. Amid the chaos, males and females find each other, coming partly out of their shells so the male can transfer a sperm packet to the female, which fertilizes her eggs. She later carries her eggs to the water\u2019s edge, where contact with seawater causes the eggs to burst and the larvae to float away. An elegant hermit crab, Calcinus elegans, at the Blank Park Zoo. The larval crabs will live on ocean plankton, molting through several stages before acquiring a shell of their own and coming back to land. Hermit crabs don\u2019t breed well in captivity, and so the numerous land hermit crabs seen in pet stores and tourist shops are taken from the wild, which is considered an unsustainable practice. Plastic pollution is also a problem for hermit crabs, which often mistake a plastic bottle cap or container for a new home. A 2020 study in the Journal of Hazardous Materials found that around 570,000 hermit crabs die annually from getting caught in plastic debris on two tropical islands in the South Pacific. When these trapped crabs die, they release a pheromone signal to other crabs that there may be a shell available, which lures even more crabs into a death trap.

        "text": "The Greenland shark is the world\u2019s longest living vertebrate. It can live for 400 years\u2014twice the age of the longest-living land animal, the giant tortoise. There could be an individual in the ocean today that was alive during the 1665 Great Plague of London and George Washington\u2019s presidential inauguration in 1789. Despite its name, the Greenland shark is not only found in Greenland; it has been spotted as far away as the western Caribbean. Also known as the gray, ground, gurry, or sleeper shark, this animal lives in incredibly cold, deep waters, so it is much less studied than many of the more than 500 other shark species. It is one of the slowest sharks, too: Its scientific name, Somniosus microcephalus, roughly translates to \u201csleepy small-head.\u201d Yet these rare animals may be a top predator. \u00a0Many shark species can be aged by counting growth bands on their vertebrae, like rings on a tree. The Greenland shark\u2019s soft vertebrae do not have these bands, however. Instead, its age is determined by removing the layers of the lens of its eye\u2014which continues growing throughout its lifetime\u2014and radiocarbon dating the tissue in the center. Using this method, scientists discovered Greenland sharks have a life expectancy of at least 272 years and could reach 392, give or take about 120 years. What\u2019s more, these slow-growing creatures don\u2019t reach reproductive age until around 150 years old. Measuring the Greenland shark\u2019s growth rate is challenging because individuals are rarely recaptured. However, one shark tagged in 1936 had only grown 2.3 inches when it reappeared 16 years later. The largest fish in the Arctic Ocean\u2014and the only shark found there year-round\u2014the Greenland shark also inhabits the North Atlantic and Russian high Arctic. Infrequently observed at the surface, it can live in waters 7,200 feet deep and between 28.4 to 44.6 Fahrenheit (minus 2 to 7 degrees Celsius). Specially adapted for cold water, this shark\u2019s tissues contain high levels of chemical compounds that\u00a0act like anti-freeze and prevent ice crystals forming in the body. These sharks conserve energy by swimming very slowly\u2014about 1.12 feet per second\u2014but can exhibit short bursts of speed to ambush prey. Dark gray, brown, or black with a cylinder-shaped body, small eyes, rounded snout, and no anal fin, Greenland sharks resemble a submarine and can reach 23 feet long and may weigh 1.5 tons. In comparison, the great white shark grows to 15 to 20 feet but is significantly heavier, weighing 2.5 tons or more. Greenland sharks have narrow, pointed upper teeth and broader, squared teeth on the lower jaw. Holding large prey in position with their upper teeth, they roll their head in a circular motion, using the lower teeth like a blade to tear off circular chunks of flesh. Smaller prey is eaten whole. Primarily scavengers, Greenland sharks are not fussy eaters and consume a variety of fish, squid, and carrion. Stomach contents of \u00a0sharks have even included polar bears, horses, and reindeer. Evidence suggests they may be opportunistic hunters capable of ambushing seals in stealth attacks. They have been linked to the discovery of nearly 5,000 mutilated seal corpses in Nova Scotia between 1993 and 2001: The victims\u2019 pelts were ripped off in a spiral shape\u2014like a peeled orange\u2014giving the shark the gruesome, but debated, nickname of the \u201ccorkscrew killer.\u201d Arctic Greenland sharks often have poor vision because of a parasite called Ommatokoita elongata. This tiny crustacean latches onto the shark\u2019s eye, damaging the cornea and leaving scar tissue with each infection. The shark is not debilitated by its blindness as it relies heavily on other senses in its dark habitat far beneath the ice. There\u2019s no proof of Greenland sharks attacking humans: An 1859 report of a Greenland shark found with a human leg in its stomach was never corroborated. However, the animal\u2019s flesh is poisonous; eating it can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stumbling, and convulsions, also known as getting \u201cshark drunk.\u201d To make it safe for consumption, the meat must be left to rot, compressed to remove toxic fluids, then dried out for months, diced, and served\u2014an Icelandic delicacy known as k\u00e6stur h\u00e1karl. Humans do pose a threat to Greenland sharks: The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists the Greenland shark as vulnerable to extinction. The animal\u2019s slow growth rate, late maturity, and low reproduction rate make it vulnerable to threats such as fishing, pollution, and climate change. Until the 1960s they were hunted for the oil in their livers, which was used as industrial lubricant or for lamp oil. Although they are no longer targeted by fisheries, Greenland sharks are still caught accidentally and often become entangled with fishing gear. This mysterious shark is not often seen by cameras: The first photograph of a live Greenland shark wasn\u2019t taken until 1995. \u2014 National Geographic Some have speculated that Greenland shark sightings could be behind the Loch Ness monster myth. \u2014 Oceana Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The shark is not debilitated by its blindness as it relies heavily on other senses in its dark habitat far beneath the ice. There\u2019s no proof of Greenland sharks attacking humans: An 1859 report of a Greenland shark found with a human leg in its stomach was never corroborated. However, the animal\u2019s flesh is poisonous; eating it can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stumbling, and convulsions, also known as getting \u201cshark drunk.\u201d To make it safe for consumption, the meat must be left to rot, compressed to remove toxic fluids, then dried out for months, diced, and served\u2014an Icelandic delicacy known as k\u00e6stur h\u00e1karl.\n\nHumans do pose a threat to Greenland sharks: The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists the Greenland shark as vulnerable to extinction. The animal\u2019s slow growth rate, late maturity, and low reproduction rate make it vulnerable to threats such as fishing, pollution, and climate change. Until the 1960s they were hunted for the oil in their livers, which was used as industrial lubricant or for lamp oil. Although they are no longer targeted by fisheries, Greenland sharks are still caught accidentally and often become entangled with fishing gear. This mysterious shark is not often seen by cameras: The first photograph of a live Greenland shark wasn\u2019t taken until 1995."

        "title": "Giant freshwater stingray",
        "text": "The giant freshwater stingray may be the world\u2019s largest freshwater fish. It\u2019s also cloaked in mystery. No one is sure how many giant stingrays are left, which habitats they prefer, or even if they ever venture into the ocean, where their more commonly known relatives live. These ancient fish, little changed over many millions of years, can reach 16.5 feet long, including the tail. There are reports of giant stingrays weighing up to 1,300 pounds, though such accounts are not verified because weighing the enormous and awkward animals is very difficult. Brown to gray in color, the giant stingrays are wide and flat in form, and they sport long, whip-like tails. They are known to prowl river systems in Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia, often burying themselves in sandy or silty river bottoms. They breathing through holes, or spiracles, on the top of their bodies. Stingrays locate prey, usually clams and crabs, with sensors located around their mouth that can detect an animal\u2019s electrical field. Although stingrays do not readily attack humans, they are one of the few megafishes that can pose a real danger to those who handle them. Each ray has a sharp barb on the base of its tail that can easily penetrate human skin and bone, much like a hunting arrow. This stinger can be as long as 15 inches and typically introduces toxins to the victim\u2019s wound. Experts, however, stress that the rays are non-aggressive and inquisitive. A major reason why scientists know so little about giant freshwater rays is because they hide at the bottom of the river. They\u2019re not considered a good food fish in Southeast Asia, so they\u2019re rarely targeted by fishers, though they occasionally get caught in nets. If hooked, the car-size stingrays can put up a ferocious fight, and there are reports of boats dragged around for hours on the river by hooked rays, and even pulled underwater. The giant freshwater stingray has a complicated history. It belongs to the Dasyatidae family, one of four families of stingrays. First identified in Indonesia in 1852 by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker, it was essentially forgotten for more than a century before being described as a new species in 1990. In 2008, scientists concluded that this new species was in fact the same as the one Bleeker had identified, and it came to be named Urogymnus polylepis. A slightly smaller stingray found in rivers in northern Australia was previously considered a regional subpopulation of the giant freshwater stingray. In 2008 it was classified as its own species, Urogymnus dalyensis. Some scientists believe populations in Thailand and Cambodia, and those in Sumatra and Borneo, may also be genetically different enough to constitute different species. The giant freshwater stingray is classified as endangered, and there are indications that stingray numbers have dropped dramatically in recent years as the fish\u2019s river habitats have degraded. While an unstudied but relatively healthy population exists in the upper part of Cambodian section of the Mekong River, it appears the rays no longer inhabit some parts of their historical range. On the Mae Klong River in Thailand, cyanide-containing waste discharged from an ethanol plant in 2016 killed at least 70 giant stingrays, with few large rays having been seen there since. The rays have also been targeted for the burgeoning aquarium trade, though it is now illegal to fish for stingrays in Thailand.

        "title": "What we lose when animals go extinct",
        "text": "Animals are disappearing at hundreds of times the normal rate, primarily because of shrinking habitats. Their biggest threat: humans. Most of the animals shown here are among the more than 28,000 species of animals and plants that the International Union for Conservation of Nature says are threatened with extinction. That number actually understates the risk. Since 1964, when the IUCN established a \u201cred list\u201d of threatened species and began compiling data gathered worldwide, the list has become the preeminent global database of endangered life and an essential tool for conservation policy. Yet the IUCN has been able to assess only about 106,000 species of the more than 1.5 million species of animals and more than 300,000 plants that scientists have described and named\u2014which they estimate is less than a quarter of what\u2019s really out there. A recent intergovernmental report on the biodiversity crisis estimated that extinction threatens up to a million animal and plant species, known and unknown. The IUCN hopes to raise the number of species assessments to 160,000 by 2020. Next up on its agenda: a \u201cgreen list\u201d of conservation successes. It will be much shorter than the red one. Habitat loss\u2014driven primarily by human expansion as we develop land for housing, agriculture, and commerce\u2014is the biggest threat facing most animal species, followed by hunting and fishing. Even when habitat is not lost entirely, it may be changed so much that animals cannot adapt. Fences fragment a grassland or logging cuts through a forest, breaking up migration corridors; pollution renders a river toxic; pesticides kill widely and indiscriminately. To those local threats one must increasingly add global ones: Trade, which spreads disease and invasive species from place to place, and climate change, which eventually will affect every species on Earth\u2014starting with the animals that live on cool mountaintops or depend on polar ice. All of these threats lead, directly or indirectly, back to humans and our expanding footprint. Most species face multiple threats. Some can adapt to us; others will vanish. If we lived in an ordinary time\u2014time here being understood in the long, unhurried sense of a geologic epoch\u2014it would be nearly impossible to watch a species vanish. Such an event would occur too infrequently for a person to witness. In the case of mammals, the best-studied group of animals, the fossil record indicates that the \u201cbackground\u201d rate of extinction, the one that prevailed before humans entered the picture, is so low that over the course of a millennium, a single species should disappear. But of course we don\u2019t live in an ordinary time. Everywhere we look, species are winking out. Just in the past decade, two mammal species have gone extinct: a bat known as the Christmas Island pipistrelle and a rat, the Bramble Cay melomys. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists more than 200 mammal species and subspecies as critically endangered. In some cases, like the Sumatran rhino or the vaquita\u2014a porpoise native to the Gulf of California\u2014there are fewer than a hundred individuals left. In others, like the baiji (also known as the Yangtze River dolphin), the species, though not yet officially declared extinct, has probably died out. And unfortunately, what goes for mammals goes for just about every other animal group: reptiles, amphibians, fish, even insects. Extinction rates today are hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of times higher than the background rate. They\u2019re so high that scientists say we\u2019re on the brink of a mass extinction. Ages 7-12 The last mass extinction, which did in the dinosaurs some 66 million years ago, followed an asteroid impact. Today the cause of extinction seems more diffuse. It\u2019s logging and poaching and introduced pathogens and climate change and overfishing and ocean acidification. But trace all these back and you find yourself face-to-face with the same culprit. The great naturalist E.O. Wilson has noted that humans are the \u201cfirst species in the history of life to become a geophysical force.\u201d Many scientists argue that we have entered a new geologic epoch\u2014the Anthropocene, or age of man. This time around, in other words, the asteroid is us. What's lost when an animal goes extinct? One way to think of a species, be it of ape or of ant, is as an answer to a puzzle: how to live on planet Earth. A species\u2019 genome is a sort of manual; when the species perishes, that manual is lost. We are, in this sense, plundering a library\u2014the library of life. Instead of the Anthropocene, Wilson has dubbed the era we are entering the Eremozoic\u2014the age of loneliness. Joel Sartore has been photographing animals for his Photo Ark project for 13 years. In an ever growing number of cases, animals housed in zoos or special breeding facilities are among the last remaining members of their species. In some instances, they are the only members. Toughie, a Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed tree frog from central Panama, lived at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. He became the last known of his kind when a fungal disease swept through his native habitat and a captive-breeding program failed. Toughie died in 2016, and it\u2019s likely the Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed tree frog is now extinct. Romeo, a Sehuencas water frog that lives at the natural history museum in Cochabamba, Bolivia, was likewise believed to be a sole survivor. Scientists created an online dating profile for him. It linked to a donation page, and the $25,000 raised helped fund expeditions in the eastern Andes, where the species was once abundant. Amazingly, the search has revealed five more Sehuencas water frogs, two males and three females. All were taken to Cochabamba; the one female mature enough to breed with Romeo was named Juliet. Whether she will prove a worthy mate and perpetuate the species, no one knows. Was the Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed tree frog beautiful? Not in the flashy way of, say, the Spix\u2019s macaw (which is believed to be extinct in the wild) or the Gee\u2019s golden langur (which is endangered). But with its expressive brown eyes and gangly limbs, it had its own kind of charm. Sartore treats all creatures\u2014great and small, handsome and homely\u2014with reverence. His photos capture what\u2019s singular and, I\u2019d also like to say, soulful about every living thing. One of my favorite images of Joel\u2019s is of a Partula nodosa, or niho tree snail, laying down a trail of slime. There used to be dozens of Partula species in the South Pacific, occupying different islands and different ecological niches. Much like Darwin\u2019s finches, they are the darlings of evolutionary biologists\u2014living, slime-producing illustrations of the power of natural selection. The introduction of carnivorous snails from Florida drove nearly a third of the Partula species extinct; several survive solely thanks to captive-breeding programs. Precisely because extinction takes place so frequently now, it\u2019s possible to become inured to it. This desensitizing is what makes Sartore\u2019s images so crucial: They show us just how remarkable each species is that\u2019s being lost. We live in an extraordinary time. Perhaps by recognizing this, we can begin to imagine creating a different one\u2014one that preserves, as much as is still possible, the wonderful diversity of life. Since the 1980s, a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, likely spread through direct contact and by infected water, has ravaged global amphibian populations. More than 500 species have been affected; 90 of these may be extinct. The fungus disrupts transmission of electrolytes through the skin of a frog or toad, ultimately stopping its heart. Butterflies can fly long distances and feed on many types of flowers, but caterpillars are locavores, eating plants they hatch on or near. As those plants are lost to development or farming, butterflies disappear. The ones here aren\u2019t listed by the IUCN\u2014which has evaluated only 8,100 insect species\u2014but are considered at risk by other authorities. For tree-dwelling lemurs, there\u2019s no life without the forest\u2014or Madagascar, their only home. Yet the island nation has lost 80 percent of its trees to development, charcoal production, and slash-and-burn agriculture. Lemurs are squeezed into limited protected areas; 38 species are critically endangered. Fuel-efficient stoves are being introduced to encourage people to reduce wood use and protect forest habitat.

        "title": "Inside the harsh lives of wolves living at the top of the world",
        "text": "Our writer spent 30 hours traveling with arctic wolves and gained a new appreciation for these predators of the tundra. In the blue light of an early Arctic morning, seven wolves slid across a frozen pond, yipping and squealing and chasing a chunk of ice about the size of a hockey puck. The pond was opalescent at that hour, a mirror of the universe, and the wolves also seemed otherworldly in their happiness. Back and forth across the pond they chased, four pups scrambling after the puck and three older wolves knocking them down, checking their little bodies into frozen grass at the shore. In my notebook, in letters made nearly illegible by my shivering, I wrote the word \u201cgoofy.\u201d The largest wolf, a yearling male, was a bully at 70 pounds or so. The smallest, the runt of that year\u2019s litter, was hardly bigger than a throw pillow, her eyes lined in black. A pair of ravens sailed overhead, and apart from their jeering, there was no sound on the tundra but the voices of wolves and the click of claws on the ice. Eventually the puck skittered into the grass, and the largest pup chased it down and chomped it to pieces. The rest stood watching, heads cocked to the side. As though they were stunned by the rudeness of it. Then, one by one, the wolves turned and looked at me. This is a difficult sensation to describe\u2014the lock-on moment when a group of predators sights you and holds your gaze for a dozen heartbeats. Humans aren\u2019t usually the objects of such appraisal, though my body seemed to recognize it way down beyond thought. I shivered again, and this time it wasn\u2019t from the cold. However playful they\u2019d appeared a few minutes before, these were wild wolves. Their white coats were dark with gore. The carcass they\u2019d been feeding on, a muskox many times larger than me, lay nearby with its rib cage cracked open, the bones splayed like a fan against the sky. The wolves watched me silently, but they were talking to each other with flicks of their ears, the posture of their tails. They were making decisions. And after a few moments they decided to come closer. Ages 7-12 There is probably no other place on Earth where this would happen. It\u2019s why I traveled to Ellesmere Island, high in the Canadian Arctic, joining a documentary film crew. The landscape is so remote, and in winter so cold, that humans rarely visit. A weather station named Eureka is pinned to the west coast and maintains a year-round staff of about eight. Otherwise the nearest community (population 129) is Grise Fiord, 250 miles to the south. A thousand miles past that stands the nearest plant you would actually recognize as a tree. What this means is that the wolves in this part of Ellesmere\u2014the same species of gray wolf (Canis lupus) that lives in the northern Rockies, much of Canada, and small, scattered populations across Europe and Asia\u2014have never been hunted, never chased away by development, never poisoned or snared by ranchers. Cars don\u2019t crush them; fickle legislation doesn\u2019t protect them one year and endanger them the next. Only a few scientists have ever studied them. Even among the Inuit I know, whose ancestors have inhabited this region for millennia, these wolves stand apart. This isn\u2019t to say that the Ellesmere wolves never encounter people. Beginning in 1986, the legendary biologist L. David Mech spent 25 summers observing wolves here. Weather station personnel see them often, and large groups of wolves have been reported wandering through the station grounds. And my friends on the film crew had essentially embedded with the pack I came to know for a few weeks, using ATVs to follow their relentless movement. Did this human contact somehow make them less wild? Is the measure of an animal\u2019s wildness equal to the distance it keeps from humans? The Ellesmere wolves are separated from their relatives living on much tamer landscapes to the south, such as Idaho or Montana, by far more than distance. Up here, wolves were never driven to the edge of extinction by humans. Here they live so far beyond the human shadow, they aren\u2019t necessarily frightened of it, of us. To visit them is to surrender control and enter another world. A 12-week-old pup stretches in the September twilight after feeding on a fresh muskox carcass. Now big enough to travel, the pups must gain weight and learn crucial survival skills\u2014including hunting and avoiding other packs\u2014before winter sets in. On the frozen pond that day, the pack approached slowly, heads low, noses gathering scent. It was early September, 27\u00b0F. The brief Arctic summer had ended, though the sun still lingered in the sky each day for 20 hours or so. True night, the winter night that would last four months and see temperatures fall to 60 below, was still a few weeks away. I was alone, unarmed. I would eventually rendezvous with my friends, but for now they were about five miles south. I sat on the ice, thinking that a few times in my life I had been this solitary, but I\u2019d never been so vulnerable. The wolves parted around me like smoke. Their winter coats were coming in. As they passed, markings that had distinguished them during our filming loomed into close-up view\u2014the yearling male with gray hairs in his ruff, the female whose left eyeball had been punctured, probably during battle with a muskox. Black tips on the pups\u2019 tails that would soon turn white. I could smell the gravy of muskox blood they\u2019d been rolling in. The pups loped past at a distance, clumsy on their enormous paws. But the older wolves drew nearer. A bold female, probably two or three years old, walked up and stood at arm\u2019s length. Her eyes were bright amber, her snout darkened with old blood or perhaps burned trash from Eureka\u2019s dump, which the wolves were known to visit. It was a jarring thought\u2014she might have a mustache of melted plastic\u2014but it vanished into the moment: A couple of feet away a wild wolf was staring at me. I decided to keep still and watched, enthralled. I could hear gastric sounds, the wet squeeze of a roiling stomach. She looked me up and down, her nose ticking through the air as though she were sketching. Then she stepped nearer, and suddenly pressed her nose to my elbow. It was electric\u2014and I twitched. The wolf leaped away and trotted onward, unhurried, glancing over her shoulder as she joined the rest of her family, busy burying their faces in leftover muskox. It\u2019s tempting to think of wolves as we do dogs\u2014companionable, limited, even cartoonish in their appetites or tendencies. Partly this is because they are visibly similar; partly it\u2019s because the comparison puts us at ease in the presence of a creature that for ages has been mythologized as a heedless killer. My encounter with the Ellesmere wolves erased any lingering thoughts of dogs. The bright-eyed female had examined me methodically. Calmly. She barely broke eye contact, and I glimpsed a radiant intelligence far beyond anything I\u2019d known in another animal. There was an unmistakable sense that, in the depths of our coding, we knew each other. I don\u2019t mean any sort of personal connection. She was not my spirit animal. I\u2019m talking about genetic blueprinting, a species-level familiarity. Wolves are slightly older than modern humans, and so were fully formed when Homo sapiens emerged. It is no great stretch to believe that in our youth, we watched wolves hunt and learned from them, even while some became our pets. Wolves, like humans, are also one of the most successful and versatile predators on the planet, and they live in family groups that are, by some measures, more similar to human families than even those of our closest primate relatives are. As climate change transforms the Arctic into a warmer, less predictable frontier, wolves will probably adapt the way we would\u2014by exploiting new advantages and, if things go to hell, by migrating somewhere else. Shortly before I arrived on Ellesmere, the pack lost its mother. She had been maybe five or six years old, thin in the hips, slow to rise, and yet so firmly in charge that when my friends encountered her, in August, they didn\u2019t notice her frailty. She was likely mother to every wolf in the pack except her mate, a slender male with a bright white coat. He was the group\u2019s lead hunter, but she was its center. There seemed no question about who led. The matriarch hadn\u2019t shown much interest in my friends and their cameras, though she allowed them intimately near her newborns, setting a tone that would carry over into the pack\u2019s tolerance toward me. The crew told me her final act, a week or so earlier, had been one of unexpected devotion. After several failed hunts (wolf hunts often do not succeed), the pack managed to drag down a muskox calf weighing about 200 pounds. They hadn\u2019t eaten a large meal for a while, and the wolves gathered around, panting, exhausted, ravenous. But the matriarch stood beside the carcass and fended off her older children, allowing only the four pups to eat. The older wolves begged, whined, shimmied forward on their bellies, hoping for a mouthful. She held firm, snapping and growling, while the pups gorged, until their bellies swelled to the size of bowling balls. It was probably their first meal of fresh meat. Eventually everyone was allowed into the feed. The animals stuffed themselves and fell into the wolf version of a food coma. At some point after that, the matriarch vanished. She never returned, and we never learned what became of her. By the time I sat alone with the pack, they were still in disarray. It wasn\u2019t clear who would lead or whether the family would hunt well together. Winter was just weeks away, the starving time. The young bright-eyed female who\u2019d nudged my elbow seemed eager to fill her mother\u2019s role, though she cared little for nurturing the pups. And during her first attempt at leading a hunt with the pack\u2019s elder male, she\u2019d been flattened by a muskox. A few hundred yards away I had watched as the big beast lowered its head and dug at her with its horns. I thought she\u2019d been gored. Instead, she bounced up and skittered away, tail between her legs, and the hunt fell apart. I sat with the wolves by the pond for nearly 30 hours, unable to tear myself away, unwilling for it to end. Whatever decisions or stress the pack faced, it was a happy time. They played, napped, nuzzled. I tried to keep them at a distance, but the wolves routinely wandered over to inspect me. I could smell their awful breath, hear their awful farts. Their interest slowly faded, but it was so cold that every hour I was forced to stand and do a warm-up session of shadowboxing and jumping jacks. My flapping and panting always lured the wolves back. They would surround me, cockeyed and curious, and they must have sensed I was nervous. At a certain point, I set up a tent a distance away to get a few hours of sleep. While I was off melting ice to make drinking water, the one-eyed female approached and surgically slit open the tent. She hauled all of my possessions onto the barren ground, arranged them in a neat row, then ran off with my inflatable pillow. The wolves keep three male muskoxen in their sights. To kill one of these animals, which can weigh up to 650 pounds, the pack must learn to cooperate. The wolves look for opportunities to isolate one muskox from the protection of the herd. These muskoxen deterred the threat. Eventually, the wolves lay down, and the pups piled together in a downy mess. While they slept, I wandered. The migrant birds had flown south; foxes and ravens were silent. Strands of muskox hair, shed during the summer and smelling sweet as fresh-cut grass, streamed across the plain. Here and there ancient muskox skulls sank into the soil, the thick bone yellowed with lichen, the horns curling toward the sky. I felt like a trespasser drifting through the rooms of an empty house. Hours later, the pack awoke and gathered in their usual post-nap huddle, with lots of face licking and tail wagging. It went on like this for a while, love at the end of the Earth, until the older wolves trotted off, heading west toward prime hunting ground, leaving the four pups alone with me. It seemed to confuse them, and me. This was not necessarily trust, more like nonchalance. I was neither prey nor threat but some third thing, and the older wolves understood this. I can\u2019t tell you which members of the family survived winter, or whether they learned to hunt together again. Odds are good they did, just as odds are poor that all the pups lived. After the last of the older wolves dropped out of sight that day, the pups decided to get up and lope after them. I followed, and soon all five of us were lost. We wandered for an hour, and then along some nameless ridge, the pups sat down and began to howl, their little voices tumbling over the rocks. After a feeding, the pack rests and digests the meal. Wolves live a feast-or-famine lifestyle. Most hunts are unsuccessful, and adults can go two weeks without eating. After a kill they gorge themselves, consuming up to 20 pounds of meat at once. It won\u2019t be long before they\u2019re on the move again. Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved",

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nIn the blue light of an early Arctic morning, seven wolves slid across a frozen pond, yipping and squealing and chasing a chunk of ice about the size of a hockey puck. The pond was opalescent at that hour, a mirror of the universe, and the wolves also seemed otherworldly in their happiness. Back and forth across the pond they chased, four pups scrambling after the puck and three older wolves knocking them down, checking their little bodies into frozen grass at the shore. In my notebook, in letters made nearly illegible by my shivering, I wrote the word \u201cgoofy.\u201d \n\nThe largest wolf, a yearling male, was a bully at 70 pounds or so. The smallest, the runt of that year\u2019s litter, was hardly bigger than a throw pillow, her eyes lined in black. A pair of ravens sailed overhead, and apart from their jeering, there was no sound on the tundra but the voices of wolves and the click of claws on the ice. Eventually the puck skittered into the grass, and the largest pup chased it down and chomped it to pieces. The rest stood watching, heads cocked to the side. As though they were stunned by the rudeness of it. \n\nThen, one by one, the wolves turned and looked at me. This is a difficult sensation to describe\u2014the lock-on moment when a group of predators sights you and holds your gaze for a dozen heartbeats. Humans aren\u2019t usually the objects of such appraisal, though my body seemed to recognize it way down beyond thought. I shivered again, and this time it wasn\u2019t from the cold. However playful they\u2019d appeared a few minutes before, these were wild wolves. Their white coats were dark with gore. The carcass they\u2019d been feeding on, a muskox many times larger than me, lay nearby with its rib cage cracked open, the bones splayed like a fan against the sky. \n\nThe wolves watched me silently, but they were talking to each other with flicks of their ears, the posture of their tails. They were making decisions. And after a few moments they decided to come closer. \n\nAges 7-12 \n\nThere is probably no other place on Earth where this would happen. It\u2019s why I traveled to Ellesmere Island, high in the Canadian Arctic, joining a documentary film crew. The landscape is so remote, and in winter so cold, that humans rarely visit. A weather station named Eureka is pinned to the west coast and maintains a year-round staff of about eight. Otherwise the nearest community (population 129) is Grise Fiord, 250 miles to the south. A thousand miles past that stands the nearest plant you would actually recognize as a tree. \n\nWhat this means is that the wolves in this part of Ellesmere\u2014the same species of gray wolf (Canis lupus) that lives in the northern Rockies, much of Canada, and small, scattered populations across Europe and Asia\u2014have never been hunted, never chased away by development, never poisoned or snared by ranchers. Cars don\u2019t crush them; fickle legislation doesn\u2019t protect them one year and endanger them the next. Only a few scientists have ever studied them. Even among the Inuit I know, whose ancestors have inhabited this region for millennia, these wolves stand apart. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the Ellesmere wolves never encounter people. Beginning in 1986, the legendary biologist L. David Mech spent 25 summers observing wolves here. Weather station personnel see them often, and large groups of wolves have been reported wandering through the station grounds. And my friends on the film crew had essentially embedded with the pack I came to know for a few weeks, using ATVs to follow their relentless movement. \n\nDid this human contact somehow make them less wild? Is the measure of an animal\u2019s wildness equal to the distance it keeps from humans? The Ellesmere wolves are separated from their relatives living on much tamer landscapes to the south, such as Idaho or Montana, by far more than distance. Up here, wolves were never driven to the edge of extinction by humans. Here they live so far beyond the human shadow, they aren\u2019t necessarily frightened of it, of us. \n\nTo visit them is to surrender control and enter another world. \n\nA 12-week-old pup stretches in the September twilight after feeding on a fresh muskox carcass. Now big enough to travel, the pups must gain weight and learn crucial survival skills\u2014including hunting and avoiding other packs\u2014before winter sets in. \n\nOn the frozen pond that day, the pack approached slowly, heads low, noses gathering scent. It was early September, 27\u00b0F. The brief Arctic summer had ended, though the sun still lingered in the sky each day for 20 hours or so. True night, the winter night that would last four months and see temperatures fall to 60 below, was still a few weeks away. I was alone, unarmed. I would eventually rendezvous with my friends, but for now they were about five miles south. I sat on the ice, thinking that a few times in my life I had been this solitary, but I\u2019d never been so vulnerable. \n\nThe wolves parted around me like smoke. Their winter coats were coming in. As they passed, markings that had distinguished them during our filming loomed into close-up view\u2014the yearling male with gray hairs in his ruff, the female whose left eyeball had been punctured, probably during battle with a muskox. Black tips on the pups\u2019 tails that would soon turn white. I could smell the gravy of muskox blood they\u2019d been rolling in. \n\nThe pups loped past at a distance, clumsy on their enormous paws. But the older wolves drew nearer.

        "title": "What I learned documenting the last male northern white rhino\u2019s death",
        "text": "The rhino and the people who tried to save his species taught one photographer indelible lessons. I began my career covering conflicts. Starting at 26, I found myself in places such as Kosovo, Angola, Gaza, Afghanistan, and Kashmir. My reason for going, I told myself, was to document the brutality. I thought the most powerful stories were those driven by violence and destruction. While the importance of shining a light on human conflict shouldn\u2019t be minimized, focusing only on that turned my world into a horror show. But slowly, as I covered conflict after conflict, it became clear to me that journalists also have an obligation to illuminate the things that unite us as human beings. If we choose to look for what divides us, we will find it. If we choose to look for what brings us together, we will find that too. Those years in war zones led me to an epiphany: Stories about people and the human condition are also about nature. If you dig deep enough behind virtually every human conflict, you will find an erosion of the bond between humans and the natural world around them. These truths became personal guideposts when I met Sudan, a northern white rhinoceros and, eventually, the last male of his kind. I saw Sudan for the first time in 2009 at the Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in Czechia (the Czech Republic). I can recall the exact moment. Surrounded by snow in his brick and iron enclosure, Sudan was being crate trained\u2014learning to walk into the giant box that would carry him almost 4,000 miles south to Kenya. He moved slowly, cautiously. He took time to sniff the snow. He was gentle, hulking, otherworldly. I knew I was in the presence of an ancient being, millions of years in the making (fossil records suggest that the lineage is over 50 million years old), whose kind had roamed around much of our world. On that winter\u2019s day, Sudan was one of only eight northern white rhinos left alive on the planet. A century ago there were hundreds of thousands of rhinos in Africa. By the early 1980s, hunting had reduced their numbers to around 19,000. Rhino horns, like our fingernails, are simply keratin, with no special curative powers, yet they\u2019ve long been valued by people around the world as antidotes for ailments from fever to impotence. Ages 7-12 When I met Sudan, the remaining northern white rhinos were all in zoos, safe from poaching but with limited success at breeding. Conservationists had hatched a bold plan to airlift four of the rhinos to Kenya. The rhinos, it was hoped, would be stimulated by their ancestral habitat\u2019s air, water, food, and room to roam. They would breed, and their offspring could be used to repopulate Africa. When I first heard of this plan, it sounded to me like something out of a children\u2019s story. But I quickly realized that this was a desperate, last-ditch effort to save a species. Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya Wildlife Service, Fauna & Flora International, Back to Africa, and Lewa Wildlife Conservancy worked hard to make the move possible. On a frigid December night the four rhinos left the Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in Czechia for Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. How did we arrive at the point where such desperate measures were necessary? It\u2019s astonishing that a demand for rhino horn based on little more than superstition has caused the wholesale slaughter of a species. But it\u2019s encouraging that a disparate group of people came together in an attempt to save something unique and precious, something that once lost would be gone forever. Meeting Sudan in Czechia changed the trajectory of my life. Today my work doesn\u2019t focus only on the human condition. Rather, I tell stories about nature, and in so doing, I tell stories about our home, our future, and the interdependence of all life. Nine years after the airlift, I received a call to hurry to Kenya. At 45, Sudan was elderly for his species. He had lived a long life, but now he was dying.

        "onlytext": "I began my career covering conflicts. Starting at 26, I found myself in places such as Kosovo, Angola, Gaza, Afghanistan, and Kashmir. My reason for going, I told myself, was to document the brutality. I thought the most powerful stories were those driven by violence and destruction. While the importance of shining a light on human conflict shouldn\u2019t be minimized, focusing only on that turned my world into a horror show. But slowly, as I covered conflict after conflict, it became clear to me that journalists also have an obligation to illuminate the things that unite us as human beings. If we choose to look for what divides us, we will find it. If we choose to look for what brings us together, we will find that too.\n\nThose years in war zones led me to an epiphany: Stories about people and the human condition are also about nature. If you dig deep enough behind virtually every human conflict, you will find an erosion of the bond between humans and the natural world around them.\n\nI saw Sudan for the first time in 2009 at the Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in Czechia (the Czech Republic). I can recall the exact moment. Surrounded by snow in his brick and iron enclosure, Sudan was being crate trained\u2014learning to walk into the giant box that would carry him almost 4,000 miles south to Kenya. He moved slowly, cautiously. He took time to sniff the snow. He was gentle, hulking, otherworldly. I knew I was in the presence of an ancient being, millions of years in the making (fossil records suggest that the lineage is over 50 million years old), whose kind had roamed around much of our world.\n\nOn that winter\u2019s day, Sudan was one of only eight northern white rhinos left alive on the planet. A century ago there were hundreds of thousands of rhinos in Africa. By the early 1980s, hunting had reduced their numbers to around 19,000. Rhino horns, like our fingernails, are simply keratin, with no special curative powers, yet they\u2019ve long been valued by people around the world as antidotes for ailments from fever to impotence.\n\nWhen I met Sudan, the remaining northern white rhinos were all in zoos, safe from poaching but with limited success at breeding. Conservationists had hatched a bold plan to airlift four of the rhinos to Kenya. The rhinos, it was hoped, would be stimulated by their ancestral habitat\u2019s air, water, food, and room to roam. They would breed, and their offspring could be used to repopulate Africa.\n\nWhen I first heard of this plan, it sounded to me like something out of a children\u2019s story. But I quickly realized that this was a desperate, last-ditch effort to save a species. Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya Wildlife Service, Fauna & Flora International, Back to Africa, and Lewa Wildlife Conservancy worked hard to make the move possible. On a frigid December night the four rhinos left the Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in Czechia for Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.\n\nHow did we arrive at the point where such desperate measures were necessary? It\u2019s astonishing that a demand for rhino horn based on little more than superstition has caused the wholesale slaughter of a species. But it\u2019s encouraging that a disparate group of people came together in an attempt to save something unique and precious, something that once lost would be gone forever.\n\nMeeting Sudan in Czechia changed the trajectory of my life. Today my work doesn\u2019t focus only on the human condition. Rather, I tell stories about nature, and in so doing, I tell stories about our home, our future, and the interdependence of all life.\n\nNine years after the airlift, I received a call to hurry to Kenya. At 45, Sudan was elderly for his species. He had lived a long life, but now he was dying. In his last years he experienced again his native grasslands, although always in the company of armed guards to keep him safe from poachers. And he had found stardom\u2014he\u2019d been affectionately dubbed the \u201cmost eligible bachelor in the world.\u201d\n\nSudan\u2019s death was not unexpected, yet it resonated with so many. When I arrived, he was surrounded by the people who had loved him and protected him. Joseph Wachira, the man pictured with Sudan, and one of his dedicated keepers, went to give him one more rub behind his ear. Sudan leaned his heavy head into Wachira\u2019s. I took a photo of two old friends together for the last time.\n\nThose final moments were quiet\u2014the rain falling, a single goaway bird scolding, and the muffled sorrow of Sudan\u2019s caretakers. These keepers spend more time protecting the northern white rhinos than they do with their own children. Watching a creature die\u2014one who is the last of its kind\u2014is something I hope never to experience again.

        "title": "To save birds, should we kill off cats?",
        "text": "Our feline friends are killing billions of birds every year. A fan of both animals believes there are humane solutions. My cat, Bernstein, likes bird-watching almost as much as I do. Bernstein is an easygoing three-year-old short-haired tabby whose other passions include laser pointers, elastic hair bands, and dental floss. And me, I\u2019m a 33-year-old short-haired blond who has always been, petwise, a cat person. Bernstein and I often hang out together in the living room, appreciating the natural order of hummingbirds and chickadees outside our window. Bernstein was a tiny kitten, unable to eat or open his eyes, when he was rescued after being abandoned in a barn. (His littermate, Woodward, remains with the journalist friend who rescued them.) He\u2019s one lucky cat\u2014and I\u2019ve wondered if his genial personality might be due, at least in part, to everlasting gratitude for having dodged a lifetime of starvation, shelters, and other feral fates. But no nature or nurture can override the feline instinct, as I was sadly reminded last spring. On a warm afternoon, I let Bernstein onto the patio for some sun. After slinking off for a few minutes, he proudly returned, clutching a ball of feathers: a one-ounce, beautifully shade-dappled Swainson\u2019s thrush that had just flown several thousand miles from Central America to Oregon to sing for a mate in my backyard. Dead as a doornail. I couldn\u2019t blame Bernstein. He was just putting his instincts and ninja skills into practice. Still, as the little thrush went cold in my hands, my heart sank. Several years ago, a team of Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service researchers combined data from dozens of previous studies to estimate, as rigorously as possible, how many birds are killed by cats each year in the contiguous United States. Their results were startling. After carefully quantifying cat populations and predation rates (and the uncertainty of both), the scientists calculated that domestic cats pounce on one billion to four billion birds a year in the lower 48 states, as well as 6.3 billion to 22.3 billion small mammals and hundreds of millions of reptiles and amphibians. About two-thirds of the bird deaths were attributed to feral cats, living wild. As birds\u2019 total U.S. population at any given moment has been estimated at around 10 billion to 20 billion, that feral cat toll would probably exceed all mortality from window strikes, roadkill, pesticides, pollution, windmills, and all other unnatural causes combined, except habitat loss and possibly climate change\u2014a staggering thought. Whoa, did that study ruffle fur and feathers! This wasn\u2019t surprising, considering its heady concoction of charismatic animals, life and death, and ungraspable numbers. Some people disbelieved the estimates or relentlessly attacked the scientists for being \u201canti-cat.\u201d Others felt vindicated, if their views fit the new evidence. Media reports pitched cat people against bird people, animal rights advocates against ecologists, and pet owners against academics. One of the researchers cowrote a book, Cat Wars\u2014which did not exactly smooth things over\u2014and described receiving death threats. Ages 7-12 All this static did not negate the key finding: that when cats are introduced predators\u2014that is, they\u2019re brought into an ecosystem where they prey on native animals but nothing much preys on them\u2014they are a serious source of mortality for birds and other native wildlife. Follow-up studies have confirmed the scale of the threat. For example, the most comprehensive inquiry in Canada, which has fewer total cats than the United States, estimated that 100 million to 350 million birds are taken by cats each year. The situation is acute yet oddly unfathomable. Everyone knows cats are predators, but until recently the impact of cats on wildlife was barely recognized. Even when presented with raw kill data, many people, including the overwhelming majority of cat owners, still doubt that cats adversely affect wild bird populations. Maybe this reflects our inherent difficulty in reckoning with broad, incremental effects (like, say, climate change). Or maybe we should all lighten up. No study has definitively linked cat predation to mainland bird population trends (though islands are another story). It\u2019s difficult to isolate one factor for the widespread decline of many birds because numerous other variables are also at work. \u201cThe status of the world\u2019s birds continues to deteriorate, and even once common birds are vanishing,\u201d says a recent report from BirdLife International. It cites agriculture and logging as today\u2019s top threats to imperiled species and ranks introduced predators a distant third. In terms of trashing the planet, humans are plainly the worst offenders. And blaming cats only deflects our responsibility onto an animal with no concept of saving the world. People generally agree that the feral cat population is too large. But there the agreement stops, partly because right now we have no good solutions. Birds aside, feral cats pose all kinds of intractable health, safety, and philosophical dilemmas that have overwhelmed our current systems. No matter how you believe cats should be treated, the world has just too many cats to manage. This is, in fact, the most succinct argument for leaving cats alone: We\u2019ll never be able to get rid of them, no matter how hard we try. Long after humankind has faded from this planet, cats will surely be scratching around whatever\u2019s left of it. But if we give up on seemingly unresolvable problems, the world will grow more miserable, not less so. I think we can do better. Some are already taking action. Cat advocates have widely embraced trap-neuter-return programs, which sterilize feral cats and then return them to the wild. Bird conservation groups mostly oppose this policy, and the animal rights group PETA stands morally against it, but these organizations offer few feasible alternatives beyond keeping cats indoors (an excellent idea). Meanwhile, U.S. animal shelters euthanize more than a million unwanted cats each year, an unpopular solution to the ultimate problem. Me, I don\u2019t have the answer. But I do have a suggestion. Back when I took Bernstein to be neutered by the local vet, I wish he\u2019d also been microchipped, not as a voluntary add-on but as standard practice. A chip the size of a grain of rice is easier to administer than a blood test, yet microchips are still mostly absent from the domestic cat world. We\u2019d have fewer cats at large if all cats were chipped: Lost animals could easily be returned, and abandoned animals could be traced to those who dumped them. I would happily pay a fee for this effort, especially if part of that contribution went toward building up our shelter system or other programs designed to address the feral cat population with proper resources. Even a small, onetime fee for each pet cat in the United States\u2014insignificant against the cost of a lifetime of cat food\u2014could generate billions of dollars. I know it\u2019s not a perfect or complete solution, and a tangle of details would have to be worked out. But regulating cats would be a good start toward mitigating our current feline free-for-all. No one who loves animals wants to leave this kind of legacy. We must do our best to care for our planet, because we\u2019re the ones responsible. Bernstein is too busy watching birds\u2014safely, through our living room window. Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "Black Rhinoceros",
        "text": "Both black and white rhinoceroses are actually gray. They are different not in color but in lip shape. The black rhino has a pointed upper lip, while its white relative has a squared lip. The difference in lip shape is related to the animals' diets. Black rhinos are browsers that get most of their sustenance from eating trees and bushes. They use their lips to pluck leaves and fruit from the branches. White rhinos graze on grasses, walking with their enormous heads and squared lips lowered to the ground. Except for females and their offspring, black rhinos are solitary. Females reproduce only every two and a half to five years. Their single calf does not live on its own until it is about three years old. Black rhinos feed at night and during the gloaming hours of dawn and dusk. Under the hot African sun, they take cover by lying in the shade. Rhinos are also wallowers. They often find a suitable water hole and roll in its mud, coating their skin with a natural bug repellent and sun block. Rhinos have sharp hearing and a keen sense of smell. They may find one another by following the trail of scent each enormous animal leaves behind it on the landscape. Black rhinos boast two horns, the foremost more prominent than the other. Rhino horns grow as much as three inches a year, and have been known to grow up to five feet long. Females use their horns to protect their young, while males use them to battle attackers. The prominent horn for which rhinos are so well known has also been their downfall. Many animals have been killed for the hard, hairlike growth, which is revered for medicinal uses in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The horn is also valued in North Africa and the Middle East as an ornamental dagger handle. The black rhino once roamed most of sub-Saharan Africa, but today is on the verge of extinction due to poaching fueled by commercial demand for its horn.

        "onlytext": "Both black and white rhinoceroses are actually gray. They are different not in color but in lip shape. The black rhino has a pointed upper lip, while its white relative has a squared lip. The difference in lip shape is related to the animals' diets. Black rhinos are browsers that get most of their sustenance from eating trees and bushes. They use their lips to pluck leaves and fruit from the branches. White rhinos graze on grasses, walking with their enormous heads and squared lips lowered to the ground. Except for females and their offspring, black rhinos are solitary. Females reproduce only every two and a half to five years. Their single calf does not live on its own until it is about three years old. Black rhinos feed at night and during the gloaming hours of dawn and dusk. Under the hot African sun, they take cover by lying in the shade. Rhinos are also wallowers. They often find a suitable water hole and roll in its mud, coating their skin with a natural bug repellent and sun block. Rhinos have sharp hearing and a keen sense of smell.

        "text": "An American goldfinch perches on a flowering tree branch.  The brightly colored male American goldfinch is especially recognizable. The American regularly visits seed feeders, particularly in the east. It is often very gregarious, especially during the nonbreeding season, when it flocks to roadsides and brushy fields to feed on thistle and sunflowers. It is often heard in flight, giving distinct flight calls. Polytypic (4 named ssp.; differences slight). Length 5\". Identification  A relatively large carduelid. Breeding male: unmistakable. Body entirely bright lemon yellow with white undertail coverts. Jet black cap. Black wings with yellow lesser coverts and narrow white tips to greater coverts, forming 2 white wing bars along with white edging to the tertials. White inner webs to most of the tail feathers. Pink, conical bill. Breeding female: very different from male. Underparts very yellow with white undertail coverts, while upperparts, including head, olive green. Lower wing bar buffy and quite wide. Tail feathers with white tips and inner webs. Bill pinkish. Winter male: cinnamon brown above and on breast and flanks, with white lower belly and undertail coverts, yellowish wash on throat and face, and muted black on forehead. Wings more boldly patterned. Yellow lesser coverts. Wide, whitish lower wing bar. Bill darker than in breeding season. Winter female: mostly drab gray body with black wings and 2 bold buffy wing bars. White undertail coverts and edging to tail feathers. Dark bill. Immature male: black on forehead reduced or lacking. Lesser coverts duller. Juvenile: resembles adult female. Unstreaked. Similar Species  The male is unlike any other finch in North America; the Wilson\u2019s warbler is the only other bright yellow species with a black cap, but it does not have the finchlike bill or the bold wing pattern of the American. All other plumages can be separated from the lesser goldfinch by their bolder wing pattern and white undertail coverts. The female Lawrence\u2019s goldfinch is gray like a nonbreeding adult female American, but note the American\u2019s wider, buffier wing bars and different pattern of white in tail. The call notes of the American are very distinct from those of the Lesser and the Lawrence\u2019s. Voice  Call: various, including per-chik-o-ree or a descending ti-di-di-di; given mainly in flight. Song: a long series of musical phrases, often repeated randomly; similar to the lesser. Not known to mimic other species. Status and Distribution  Common throughout much of United States and southern Canada. Breeding: a variety of habitats, from weedy fields to open second growth woodland, and along riparian corridors, particularly in the West. Does not breed over much of southern third of United States. Winter: populations from northern third of breeding range migrate to southern United States and Mexico, augmenting resident populations throughout middle section of the United States.

        "text": "The green turtle is a large, weighty sea turtle with a wide, smooth carapace, or shell. It inhabits tropical and subtropical coastal waters around the world and has been observed clambering onto land to sunbathe. It is named not for the color of its shell, which is normally brown or olive depending on its habitat, but for the greenish color of its skin. There are two types of green turtles\u2014scientists are currently debating whether they are subspecies or separate species\u2014including the Atlantic green turtle, normally found off the shores of Europe and North America, and the Eastern Pacific green turtle, which has been found in coastal waters from Alaska to Chile. Weighing up to 700 pounds green turtles are among the largest sea turtles in the world. Their proportionally small head, which is nonretractable, extends from a heart-shaped carapace that measures up to 5 feet. Males are slightly larger than females and have a longer tail. Both have flippers that resemble paddles, which make them powerful and graceful swimmers. Unlike most sea turtles, adult green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and algae. Juvenile green turtles, however, will also eat invertebrates like crabs, jellyfish, and sponges. While most sea turtles warm themselves by swimming close to the surface of shallow waters, the Eastern Pacific green turtle will take to land to bask in the sun. Occasionally seen sunbathing alongside seals and albatrosses, it is one of the few marine turtles known to leave the water other than at nesting times. Green turtles, like other sea turtles, undertake lengthy migrations from feeding sites to nesting grounds, normally on sandy beaches. Mating occurs every two to four years and normally takes place in shallow waters close to the shore. To nest, females leave the sea and choose an area, often on the same beach used by their mothers, to lay their eggs. They dig a pit in the sand with their flippers, fill it with a clutch of 100 to 200 eggs, cover the pit and return to the sea, leaving the eggs to hatch after about two months. The most dangerous time of a green turtle\u2019s life is when it makes the journey from nest to sea. Multiple predators, including crabs and flocks of gulls, voraciously prey on hatchlings during this short scamper. Green turtles are listed as an endangered species. Despite this, they are still killed for their meat and eggs. Their numbers are also reduced by boat propeller accidents, fishnet-caused drowning, and the destruction of their nesting grounds by human encroachment.

        "text": "A three-month-old male northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) at Wildlife Images. Flying squirrels are known for soaring anywhere from 150 to 500 feet, sailing from tree to tree to avoid ground predators\u2014but they actually glide rather than fly. Flying squirrels don\u2019t have their own means of propulsion, like a bird or bat, but glide using a furry membrane called the patagium that connects at their wrists down to their ankles. When they leap from a tree and spread their limbs, this flap of loose skin forms a square and acts like a hang glider. Flying squirrels can turn by lowering one arm, while a specialized piece of cartilage not found in other gliding mammals extends from the wrist to support the pagatium and help them steer. These animals are capable of making 180-degree turns in mid-air to evade flying predators like owls. Moving their hands and feet in opposite directions also helps flying squirrels direct their movements so they land safely on their strong, silent padded feet. Their long, fluffy tails stabilize their flight and flipping those tails up helps them put on the brakes. There are about 50 species of flying squirrels ranging across most of North America down into Central America, and stretching from Southeast and Northern Asia into Siberia and Scandinavia. They make their homes in in woodpecker holes, nests abandoned by birds, or tree cavities in forests, woodlands, and jungles. Aside from their patagia, flying squirrels look similar to their grounded cousins, with small rounded faces, prominent ears, and fluffy tails that can be as long as their bodies. Their eyes are large, helping these nocturnal mammals navigate the dark, and their fur color and markings vary by species. Their sizes vary as much as their color. Pakistan\u2019s woolly flying squirrel is the largest gliding mammal at five and a half pounds while Hose\u2019s pygmy flying squirrel of Borneo is the tiniest at just a little more than three ounces. Diets vary by location as well. In the Americas, the northern flying squirrel dines on insects, seeds, nuts, and fungi while the southern flying squirrel will sometimes eat eggs or carrion. Meanwhile, the Indochinese flying squirrel, found in China and parts of Southeast Asia, prefers cultivated fruit. Some flying squirrels have only one mating cycle per year but others, such as the Japanese dwarf flying squirrel, have two. The time of year for mating and birth depend on the species as well. Many are promiscuous, meaning that males and females mate with multiple partners. In some species, such as the southern flying squirrels of North and Central America, the young are born blind, hairless, and helpless, while others are more well-developed at birth. Females care for the young. There\u2019s variation in development, too; for example, southern flying squirrels are weaned at two months while black flying squirrels of Southeast Asia are weaned at four months.  Though solitary, flying squirrels will sometimes nest together, typically with family members, to keep warm in the winter months. Almost half of flying squirrel species, such as the southern flying squirrel in North and Central America and the Javanese flying squirrel of Southeast Asia, have stable populations. Their elusive nature makes them hard to study so there\u2019s little data on some species. For those with decreasing populations\u2014such as the endangered smoky flying squirrel of Southeast Asia\u2014threats include destruction of their forest habitats by logging, other types of wood harvesting, and agricultural and residential development, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Hunting and trapping are also threats to species such as Bhutan\u2019s giant flying squirrel and the Northern Chinese flying squirrel. In the United States, northern flying squirrels are endangered in Pennsylvania. Not only do they face habitat loss from development but there\u2019s also been a decline in the fungi they eat due to the presence of hemlock wooly adelgids, invasive insects that destroy the hemlock stands where fungi flourish.

        "title": "Leatherback Sea Turtle",
        "text": "Leatherbacks are the largest turtles on Earth, growing up to seven feet long and exceeding 2,000 pounds. These reptilian relics are the only remaining representatives of a family of turtles that traces its evolutionary roots back more than 100 million years. Once prevalent in every ocean except the Arctic and Antarctic, the leatherback population is rapidly declining in many parts of the world. While all other sea turtles have hard, bony shells, the inky-blue carapace of the leatherback is somewhat flexible and almost rubbery to the touch. Ridges along the carapace help give it a more hydrodynamic structure. Leatherbacks can dive to depths of 4,200 feet\u2014deeper than any other turtle\u2014and can stay down for up to 85 minutes. Leatherbacks have the widest global distribution of all reptile species, and possibly of any vertebrate. They can be found in the tropic and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. Adult leatherbacks also traverse as far north as Canada and Norway and as far south as New Zealand and South America.  Unlike their reptilian relatives, leatherbacks are able to maintain warm body temperatures in cold water by using a unique set of adaptations that allows them to both generate and retain body heat. These adaptations include large body size, changes in swimming activity and blood flow, and a thick layer of fat. Leatherbacks undertake the longest migrations between breeding and feeding areas of any sea turtle, averaging 3,700 miles each way. After mating at sea, females come ashore during the breeding season to nest. The nighttime ritual involves excavating a hole in the sand, depositing around 80 eggs, filling the nest, leaving a large, disturbed area of sand that makes detection by predators difficult, and finally returning to the sea. The temperature inside the nest determines the sex of the hatchlings. A mix of male and female hatchlings occurs when the nest temperature is approximately 85.1 degrees Fahrenheit, while higher temperatures produce females and cooler temperatures produce males. Female hatchlings that make it to sea will roam the oceans until they reach sexual maturity, when they return to the same nesting areas to produce their own offspring. Males spend the rest of their lives at sea. Many leatherbacks meet an early end due to human activity. It is estimated that only about one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings survive to adulthood. Eggs are often taken by humans from nests to be consumed for subsistence or as aphrodisiacs. Many leatherbacks fall victim to fishing lines and nets, or are struck by boats. Leatherbacks also can die if they ingest floating plastic debris mistaken for their favorite food: jellyfish. Some individuals have been found to have almost 11 pounds of plastic in their stomachs. The number of leatherbacks in the Atlantic appears to be stable or increasing, but the Pacific population is declining at an alarming rate due to egg harvest, fishery bycatch, coastal development, and highly variable food availability. Some Pacific populations have disappeared entirely from certain areas, such as Malaysia. Scientists around the world are tracking and studying leatherbacks to learn more about these reptilian giants and how they can be saved.

Atlantic horseshoe crabs may appear alien, but their history as earthlings is pretty impressive. They\u2019ve been around for 450 million years, predating the dinosaurs by more than 200 million years. They live on the Atlantic coast of North America, from Maine to down and around the Florida coast to Alabama and Mississippi. They also live around the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. Despite their common name, horseshoe crabs are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than to \u201ctrue crabs,\u201d which are crustaceans. They\u2019re in the class Merostomata, which means \u201clegs attached to the mouth\u201d because their mouths are literally in the center of all 10 legs. Horseshoe crabs also have 10 eyes\u2014a pair of compound eyes on the front shell and more photo receptors along their tail. Horseshoe crabs\u2019 bodies are divided into three segments. The head, or prosoma, houses most vital organs, including the heart and the brain. The middle segment, the opisthosoma, contains the back gills and ridges that help with movement. The third segment is the tail, or telson, which looks like a big stinger but is used to help these animals flip if overturned and acts as a rudder as they move across the ocean floor. Horseshoe crabs molt their distinctive shells about 17 times before reaching maturity at age 10. Most of us probably owe our lives to horseshoe crabs. Their blue, copper-based blood contains lysate, which reacts to bacterial toxins by clotting. Horseshoe crab blood has long been harvested to test everything from water to intravenous drugs for contamination. It's also key to making vaccines for diseases such as COVID-19. Crabs are returned to the wild afterward but the process may have a negative effect on spawning.  A synthetic version of their blood has been produced that appears to be on course to eliminate the need to use animals in endotoxin detection. The pharmaceutical industry is beginning to accept this substitute but it has not yet ended the practice of harvesting these crabs for their blood. Spawning season comes at different times of year depending on location, but the largest lovefest happens at Delaware Bay, where thousands of horseshoe crabs crawl onto the beaches in May and June. During spawning, several males gather around one female who lays her eggs in clusters of up to 5,000 apiece\u2014ultimately laying about 20,000 eggs in one night and nearly 100,000 in a season. One or more males will fertilize the eggs, which then take two weeks or more to develop and hatch.

        "text": "The critically endangered Mekong giant catfish, such as this one on a fisherman's boat, is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world.\n The Mekong giant catfish is the official freshwater heavyweight champion of the world. According to the Guinness Book of Records, a nine-foot-long individual caught in northern Thailand in 2005 weighted an astounding 646 pounds, making it the largest exclusively freshwater fish ever recorded. Despite its gargantuan size, but also because of it, the giant catfish lives a tenuous existence in the murky waters of its native river, Southeast Asia\u2019s Mekong, where its numbers have plummeted so dramatically that the species is on the brink of extinction. Gray to white in color and lacking stripes, the Mekong giant catfish has very low-set eyes, which gives it a slightly sorrowful appearance. They are distinguished from other large catfish species by their near-total lack of barbels, or \u201cwhiskers,\u201d as well as by the absence of teeth. (Juveniles have barbels, but these features shrink as they age.) As babies, they feed on zooplankton in the river and are known to be cannibalistic. After about a year, they become herbivores, and eat plants and algae. The Mekong giant catfish has one of the fastest growth rates of any fish in the world. It can reach up to 440 pounds in only six years. They can live up to 60 years. Highly migratory, the species requires large stretches of river and very specific environmental conditions for its seasonal journey to spawn and breed. While scientists don\u2019t know exactly how the fish move, the Mekong giant catfish is believed to spend much of its time feeding in Cambodia\u2019s Tonle Sap Lake and then migrating hundreds of miles north to spawning grounds in Thailand. These giant catfish were once plentiful throughout the Mekong basin, but their numbers are believed to have dropped by at least 95 percent over the past century. With no population figures available, estimates of the decline are based on the fall in the number of fish caught. Some experts think there may be only a few hundred, or even fewer, adults left in the Mekong River. Overfishing is the primary cause of the giant catfish\u2019s decline, but damming of Mekong tributaries, destruction of spawning and breeding grounds, and siltation (a process by which water becomes dirty with fine mineral particles) have also taken a huge toll. Conservationists have focused on the Mekong giant catfish as a flagship species to promote conservation on the river. It is now illegal in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia to harvest the critically endangered species, though giant catfishes still are illicitly caught, with some sold to restaurants in Vietnam. In Thailand, Mekong giant catfishes have been successfully bred in artificial ponds, but efforts to introduce these fish in the wild have largely failed. 440-pound giant catfish saved Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "text": "With their large size, bold pied plumage, and fondness for open areas, black-billed magpies are easily seen. They hop and walk on the ground with a swaggering and confident gait. Monotypic. Length 19\". Identification  An unusually long-tailed black-and-white corvid with a black bill. In good light, black on wings and tail shine with iridescent green, blue, and violet. Juvenile has milky grayish-colored iris and fleshy pinkish gape. The upperparts are washed dull brownish, and the belly is more cream-\u00adcolored. Immatures have narrower and more pointed outer tail feathers. Flight: relatively slow, with steady, rowing wingbeats, but the birds are easily able to quickly change direction in flight. Magpies usually swoop up or down to perch. Geographic Variation  While monotypic, birds in the south average smaller and tend to show bare dark grayish skin below eye (similar in shape to the yellow skin on yellow-billed magpie). Similar Species  Black bill and range distinguish this species from the yellow-billed magpie; larger size of the black-billed magpie sometimes appreciable in the field. Until recently, the black-billed magpie was lumped with the wide\u00adspread magpie (Pica pica) of Eurasia and northwestern Africa, but all evidence suggests a much closer relationship with the yellow-billed. Voice  Quite varied, but most vocalizations are rather harsh. All are very similar to that of the yellow-billed magpie. They are strikingly faster and lower pitched than Old World populations of magpie. Call: frequently gives a whining, rising mea; sometimes these are more drawn out and questioning:\u2008meeaaah. Also a quickly repeated shek-shek-shek with each phrase repeated 3\u20135 times (not as harsh or piercing as analogous vocalization of Steller\u2019s jay). Status and Distribution  Common. Resident of open woodlands and thickets in rangeland and foothills; nests along watercourses and other areas with trees and shrubs, but foraging birds use very open areas. Migration and Dispersal: generally considered to be nonmigratory, but varies regionally and by year. Dispersing flocks form as early as July and typically consist of a few to a hundred birds; occasionally forms flocks of several hundred. Movements may be upslope, downslope, or in any direction. Banding recoveries have shown atypical movements of more than 500 km. Most birds are thought to return near where they hatched to breed. Vagrant: casual to Pacific coast, western Wisconsin, Iowa, and northern Texas, mostly in fall. In summer found north as far as northern Alaska, northeastern Northwest Territories. Other sightings occur casually throughout the East and may pertain to escaped cage birds. Population  Declined throughout the Great Plains with the slaughter of bison and targeted eradication.

        "title": "Surveillance Safari: Crowdsourcing an anti-poaching movement in South Africa",
        "text": "In South Africa\u2019s Balule Nature Reserve, an all-female anti-poaching unit is using live streaming and Samsung\u2019s smartphone technology to support its conservation efforts and enlist volunteers from around the world. For upwards of three million years, we humans and our antecedents have used tools to interface with the natural world around us. But in the last few decades, the human population has exploded and our tools today are having globally damaging impacts, transforming biomes across the planet. Yet our technologies also have the potential to mend our relationship with nature, protecting ecosystems and recovering lost biodiversity\u2013if we develop and deploy them in the right ways. The earliest stone tools were discovered in Africa\u2013a continent that also harbors some of the world\u2019s most iconic wild animal species, including the so-called \u201cBig Five\u201d\u2013elephant, lion, leopard, rhinoceros and buffalo. So, it\u2019s relevant and appropriate that Samsung, one of the world\u2019s leading consumer electronics companies, is working alongside conservationists in South Africa to protect these animals and others like them. In 2020 the Kruger National Park faced a crisis. Covering just under 20,000 square kilometers of South Africa\u2019s northeast quarter, Kruger is one of Africa\u2019s biggest game reserves, typically attracting around one million visitors each year, many of whom come to see the Big Five. When South Africa entered the first phase of COVID-19 lockdowns on March 27, 2020, those visitors vanished. This spelled trouble. \u201cResources for animals, rangers and anti-poaching units were vastly depleted,\u201d says conservationist and digital marketing expert Peter Stewart. \u201cMany local people who worked in ecotourism lost their jobs, so there was a much higher risk of informal poaching.\u201d This was especially true of the iconic rhinos that are a particular target for poaching gangs in Kruger National Park. Stewart is a partner at Africam, a wildlife media company that uses live HD streaming cameras to support conservation education around the world. He and his team were approached by Samsung with a possible means of compensating for the crash in visitor numbers and the commensurate dangers this posed to wildlife in the park: If people couldn\u2019t come to Kruger, what if Samsung and Africam could bring the park to them\u2013or more precisely to their mobile devices? By combining Africam\u2019s live streaming infrastructure with the advanced camera systems and mobile technology of the latest Samsung Galaxy devices, the new partnership would build a global community of virtual rangers who could, in theory, monitor wildlife around the clock. The result was Wildlife Watch\u2013a pilot program launched on March 3, 2021, which installed Samsung Galaxy S20 FE handsets, repurposed specifically for surveillance, in the Balule Nature Reserve \u2013 an around 99,000-acre tract of land on the eastern edge of Kruger National Park. Wildlife Watch also enlisted the Black Mambas\u2013the world\u2019s first all-female anti-poaching unit, consisting of 36 rangers. The Mambas were provided with Samsung smartphones to help them monitor wildlife, communicate with one another, and document their day-to-day work. Real-time tracking meant they didn\u2019t have to rely on radios, plus fellow rangers could, for example, respond more swiftly to the presence of poachers or a pride of lions. Wildlife Watch recorded more than seven million social engagements over a four-month period, as humans everywhere turned to their mobile devices to connect with the outside world. In one instance, virtual rangers identified a wild dog with a snare on one of its legs. They quickly alerted rangers, who removed the snare and gave the animal medical treatment. What\u2019s more, the Black Mambas were a hit with global audiences and have since become important role models in their communities. \u201cOur mission is to show people that we are here and we're patrolling the boundaries of the reserve to make the Kruger National Park an undesirable place for poachers,\u201d says Sergeant Felicia Mogakane of the Black Mambas. \u201cPeople started to believe in us because they've really seen our impact\u2014that our model is effective\u2026 we are protecting the wildlife in there. Ever since we've been deployed, no rhino has been killed in our reserve.\u201d Following the success of the Wildlife Watch pilot, Samsung, Africam and the Black Mambas recently announced an expansion of the program. The second phase launched to the public on March 4, 2023 and makes use of the advanced camera systems in the latest Galaxy S21 Ultra and S23 Ultra handsets, including enhanced low-light capabilities and 10 times optical zoom to generate HD video day and night. The technology continues to support the Black Mambas in their work, not only protecting iconic wildlife in the Balule Nature Reserve, but also engaging with people in rural communities, many of whom have never seen species like lion, elephant and rhino. This second phase also tested the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 as an additional means of monitoring movements in the reserve. The tags are a great way for the Black Mambas to orient themselves in the reserve, providing location markers for things like camera traps, signs of infraction or evidence of animal behaviors. The Galaxy SmartTags can be tracked using SmartThings Find, part of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings connected ecosystem, which provides personalized and automated experiences using AI. The wild habitats that remain in sub-Saharan Africa continue to face threats from human encroachment, poaching and human-wildlife conflict. It is estimated that the region as a whole has lost around 50 percent of its large mammals in the past few decades. Whether we like it or not, we are the custodians of these spaces and their future survival depends on us. Mobile technologies are crucial to the future of conservation\u2014they provide vital tools on the ground for ranger units like the Black Mambas. But they also amplify local issues and perspectives, giving global audiences the opportunity not only to learn about these unique ecosystems and species, but also to play an active part in conserving them.

The result was Wildlife Watch\u2013a pilot program launched on March 3, 2021, which installed Samsung Galaxy S20 FE handsets, repurposed specifically for surveillance, in the Balule Nature Reserve \u2013 an around 99,000-acre tract of land on the eastern edge of Kruger National Park.\n\nWildlife Watch also enlisted the Black Mambas\u2013the world\u2019s first all-female anti-poaching unit, consisting of 36 rangers. The Mambas were provided with Samsung smartphones to help them monitor wildlife, communicate with one another, and document their day-to-day work. Real-time tracking meant they didn\u2019t have to rely on radios, plus fellow rangers could, for example, respond more swiftly to the presence of poachers or a pride of lions.\n\nWildlife Watch recorded more than seven million social engagements over a four-month period, as humans everywhere turned to their mobile devices to connect with the outside world. In one instance, virtual rangers identified a wild dog with a snare on one of its legs. They quickly alerted rangers, who removed the snare and gave the animal medical treatment. What\u2019s more, the Black Mambas were a hit with global audiences and have since become important role models in their communities.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to show people that we are here and we're patrolling the boundaries of the reserve to make the Kruger National Park an undesirable place for poachers,\u201d says Sergeant Felicia Mogakane of the Black Mambas. \u201cPeople started to believe in us because they've really seen our impact\u2014that our model is effective\u2026 we are protecting the wildlife in there. Ever since we've been deployed, no rhino has been killed in our reserve.\u201d\n\nFollowing the success of the Wildlife Watch pilot, Samsung, Africam and the Black Mambas recently announced an expansion of the program. The second phase launched to the public on March 4, 2023 and makes use of the advanced camera systems in the latest Galaxy S21 Ultra and S23 Ultra handsets, including enhanced low-light capabilities and 10 times optical zoom to generate HD video day and night.\n\nThe technology continues to support the Black Mambas in their work, not only protecting iconic wildlife in the Balule Nature Reserve, but also engaging with people in rural communities, many of whom have never seen species like lion, elephant and rhino. This second phase also tested the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 as an additional means of monitoring movements in the reserve.\n\nThe wild habitats that remain in sub-Saharan Africa continue to face threats from human encroachment, poaching and human-wildlife conflict. It is estimated that the region as a whole has lost around 50 percent of its large mammals in the past few decades. Whether we like it or not, we are the custodians of these spaces and their future survival depends on us. Mobile technologies are crucial to the future of conservation\u2014they provide vital tools on the ground for ranger units like the Black Mambas. But they also amplify local issues and perspectives, giving global audiences the opportunity not only to learn about these unique ecosystems and species, but also to play an active part in conserving them."

        "title": "Astronomers have discovered the oldest and farthest supernova ever",
        "text": "The new discoveries, based on data from the James Webb Space Telescope, provide a glimpse of the early universe. Observing a distant supernova is like looking back in time. The explosions offer astronomers a peek at what our universe was like billions of years in the past. Now astronomers have discovered 10 times more distant supernovae than anyone had seen before, including the oldest \u00a0and farthest supernova ever observed. The discoveries came from data captured by NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope. Announced at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Madison, Wisconsin, earlier this month, astronomers analyzed Webb images and found about 80 supernovae in just one tiny patch of the sky. Many of the supernovae are further out than those previously known, representing a time when the universe was a youthful two billion years old. The telescope is an ideal tool to search for such distant points of light in the universe. \u201c[Webb] is a big telescope, nearly 10 times bigger than the Hubble Space Telescope in terms of light collecting area,\u201d says Justin Pierel, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who worked on the new research. In addition to seeing a larger part of the sky, Webb is also more sensitive to the longer light wavelengths that indicate the presence of supernovae. \u201cWe knew these faint and far-off supernovae existed, but we were unable to see them prior,\u201d Pierel says.\u00a0 (Learn about what happens when stars explode.) The increased size and sensitivity of Webb allowed it to pick up what other telescopes have not been able to detect. \u201cI think it is great to see that these supernovae can be recovered in the Webb data,\u201d says Harvard University astronomer Edo Berger, who was not involved in the new research. The new data add to a growing record of exploded stars from different times in the universe\u2019s history. While finding around 80 distant supernovae in a small patch of sky is significant, Berger notes, \u201cthese are still a small fraction of all supernovae being discovered by wide-field and shallower surveys, in excess of 10,000 supernovae per year.\u201d But many of those supernovae are younger and closer to Earth. The significance of the Webb finds is in uncovering supernovae that are further out, representing a much earlier time in the universe\u2019s history. In order to find more distant and therefore more ancient supernovae, researchers compared multiple images taken by Webb over the span of a year. The astronomers looked for light sources that appeared or disappeared in the images, or what experts refer to as transients. Not only did the researchers detect dozens of supernovae, but the nature of the light indicated that the supernovae exploded billions of years before our present moment. Webb can detect supernovae thanks to a phenomenon known as cosmological redshift. As light travels through space, its wavelength is pulled like taffy. Light\u2019s wavelengths become longer, falling into the infrared part of the spectrum\u2014invisible to the naked eye, but visible to a telescope with the right equipment. Different redshift characteristics correspond to different times in the universe\u2019s history, and the present day is redshift zero. The higher the redshift, the older the supernova is. So while a redshift of 2 indicates a supernova from when the universe was about 3.3 billion years old, one of the newly-found supernovae has a redshift of 3.6 and formed when the universe was about 1.8 billion years old. That puts the ancient supernova at 12 billion years old, the oldest ever detected. The data offers a way to get a sense of what the universe was like long before Earth even existed. \u201cThe universe is nearly 14 billion years old, but these supernovae are from a time when the universe was just a couple billion years old, the equivalent of being a teenager for humans,\u201d Pierel says. The new data will provide a launching point for researchers to investigate the nature of the early universe, how stars formed, and what happened when they exploded. In fact, Pierel notes, distant stars are often too faint to see even with the most powerful telescopes. Exploding stars are brighter and easier to detect.\u00a0 Specific types of supernovae in the sample may provide some new insights, as well. Webb detected at least one supernova that astronomers categorize as Type 1a, which means it\u2019s particularly bright and could be used to measure long distances in space. \u201cFinding these higher redshift supernovae is important for making cosmological measurements,\u201d Berger says, as well as studying phenomena like dark energy. (Learn about the mysteries surrounding Type 1a supernovae.) Exploding stars are an essential part to the universe we live in. \u201cIf stars did not explode, life as we know it would not be possible,\u201d Pierel says. The elements that are so essential to life on Earth were flung out of such explosions when the universe was much younger, forming the basis for our planet and life upon it. Distant as they may be from us, the supernovae are an essential part of our own story.

        "title": "What is kratom? The truth behind the popular\u2014and controversial\u2014supplement",
        "text": "Touted as an energy booster and mood enhancer, kratom is ubiquitous in convenience stores and gas stations across the U.S. So why does the FDA list it as a \u201cdrug of concern\u201d? Kratom might be the most popular herbal product you\u2019ve never heard of. Almost two million Americans used kratom in 2021, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s\u00a0National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Although it is banned in seven states kratom is ubiquitous at U.S. gas stations, convenience stores, and online. Sourced from an Asian tree\u2019s leaves, kratom produces weak opioid-like effects. It\u2019s touted as an energy-boosting stimulant, a euphoric mood enhancer that can help anxiety or depression, and a treatment for chronic pain. But does it really work? Is it safe?\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how little information is out there given how many people use it,\u201d says Peter Grinspoon, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. (5 things you should know before trusting that supplement.) Kratom leaves and teas have been used for centuries in Southeast Asia, but the products consumed in the United States are quite different and often far more potent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists kratom as a \u201cdrug of concern,\u201d citing addiction and side effects like seizures, liver toxicity and, in rare cases, even death. Other adverse reactions to kratom use can include drowsiness, confusion, vomiting, or racing heartbeats. Yet because it\u2019s not a food, dietary supplement, or drug, kratom has a nebulous regulatory status and can be sold in many places to those as young as 13. Underlying this uncertainty is a lack of peer-reviewed research. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have a scientific understanding of the safety or the efficacy of the product,\u201d says Christopher McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida\u00a0who has studied kratom use for over a decade. The kratom tree (Mitragyna speciosa) is an evergreen in the coffee family, grown in Southeast Asia where fresh leaves are chewed as a mild stimulant, and teas are brewed as medicine to treat pain, diabetes, diarrhea, and other ailments including opium withdrawal. In the U.S., kratom is sold in dried, powdered form that\u2019s typically brewed in tea or taken in capsules. Gummies and liquid kratom doses are also sold, often with very high potency.\u00a0\u00a0 (4 herbal traditions used every day, all over the world.) Among kratom\u2019s many chemically active compounds is mitragynine, which targets the same pain-reducing receptors that are stimulated by opioids like heroin, morphine, and fentanyl.\u00a0 Another key compound is alkaloid 7-hydroxymitragynine, which has far more potent opioid-like impacts. Kratom plants contain very small amounts of 7-hydroxymitragynine but the amounts vary wildly in kratom supplements\u2014some of which are adulterated with artificially high levels of this more addictive compound. Kratom also binds to serotonin receptors, which regulate mood and anxiety, and it impacts dopamine release. These systems can also help reduce pain, McCurdy says\u2014making it difficult to parse out which compounds are really at work. \u201cWe just don\u2019t understand exactly how they are playing together,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Kratom is a stimulant at lower doses but, paradoxically, at higher doses it induces drowsiness or sedative reactions more akin to those produced by opiates. \u00a0 McCurdy and colleagues\u2019 surveys show the majority of kratom users believe it relieves their anxiety or chronic pain, and that they aren\u2019t using kratom in an abusive way. \u201cThey say I take my two or three grams of powder, morning and evening, and it helps me function or gives me energy,\u201d McCurdy says. \u201cOf course we can\u2019t say if it actually works because we don\u2019t have the scientific studies to prove that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 C. Michael White, a distinguished professor of pharmacy practice at the\u00a0University of Connecticut, agrees. \u201cData on\u00a0kratom\u00a0use for anxiety, for alertness, to reduce fatigue, or any other purpose is very scant,\u201d he says. Though no randomized, controlled clinical trials have rigorously assessed pain relief in patients, some kratom research shows promise for short-term pain relief. However, some chronic kratom users do experience increased pain and sensitivity when they stop taking it.\u00a0 (Could this be the solution to chronic pain?) \u201cI would never suggest someone use\u00a0kratom\u00a0as a pain reliever because the benefits are not established, there are many other options, and there are real risks,\u201d White says. Kratom use is common among those with opioid use disorder. Although no randomized, controlled trials prove its merit for addiction treatment, White says many people argue that using kratom helps keep them from more dangerous illicit opioids. \u201cThis is where\u00a0kratom\u00a0may actually have a role in our healthcare system,\u201d White says. \u201cIf you have access to addiction treatment, definitely try the proven options first. However, if you are unable to afford treatment, you are unwilling to out yourself and admit you have addiction, or you are not being provided sufficient treatment and will relapse to illicit opioid use,\u00a0kratom\u00a0is likely a much better option.\u201d \u201cKratom\u00a0seems much less likely to stop someone from breathing than other opioids,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause it is a central nervous system stimulant not a depressant.\u201d While kratom teas and other fresh leaf products have long been used safely in Southeast Asia, studies have shown Western users often consume very different stuff\u2014with huge, unknown variations in the amount of active chemical ingredients. \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of products that are called kratom, but I compare it to the range from a Miller Light to Everclear,\u201d McCurdy says. \u201cWe know there is a spectrum from safe to toxic, but we don\u2019t know where the break point is.\u201d Dried leaf material sold in capsules or bulk powder, used to make teas or just consumed whole, tends to be less potent, McCurdy notes. Other kratom supplements are made from leaves that have been processed, refined, or manipulated to produce extract products that deliver a higher chemical dose with a higher risk of negative effects. Then, at the extreme end, there are kratom supplements that McCurdy says are essentially synthetic 7-hydroxymitragynine products. \u201cSome things being marketed as kratom are so far removed from the plant that they are basically pharmaceuticals,\u201d McCurdy cautions. These can more easily be over-consumed, sometimes with serious consequences, sometimes by people who hope it will give them a euphoric high. \u201cUnfortunately it doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of a sudden you have a huge amount of exposure into your system and could be suddenly in the ER experiencing very negative side effects.\u201d\u00a0 Some kratom products aren\u2019t labeled either, so buyers may not be able to tell how potent they are\u2014and since kratom isn\u2019t regulated or tested it can be adulterated with lead and other heavy metals, or even other chemicals, the FDA warns. \u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West, in my opinion, and it\u2019s buyer beware,\u201d McCurdy says. Compared to strong opioids like morphine, heroin, and oxycodone, the risk of becoming addicted to kratom is relatively low; however the FDA warns that people can become addicted after taking it for long periods of time for pain, anxiety, or to boost mood or energy. \u201cYou start out voluntarily taking it, but at a certain point you need to take it just to feel regular,\u201d White says. \u201cThen if you don\u2019t take it instead of going back to your normal state you feel worse.\u201d (What can your DNA say about your risk of opioid addiction?) Some research, including a recently completed FDA Single Ascending Dose trial, suggests that taking kratom in reasonable doses may do little harm in the short term, says McCurdy, whose team partnered on the research. But the research included only a single dose, and the possible consequences of long-term use aren\u2019t well known. Numerous states have pending legislation to limit concentrations of mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine in kratom products, impose age restrictions on who can buy them, and require products to be labeled and tested. That seems like a sensible step to Grinspoon. \u201cIn a perfect world there would be a safe, regulated supply, because I actually think it can be helpful to people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I also think that kratom shows some of the big gaps in a regulatory landscape that put a lot of people at risk,\u201d he adds. \u201cA lot of people that take this are young people\u2014and right now it's sort of like an uncontrolled experiment.\u201d\u00a0 Ages 7-12 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

That seems like a sensible step to Grinspoon. \u201cIn a perfect world there would be a safe, regulated supply, because I actually think it can be helpful to people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I also think that kratom shows some of the big gaps in a regulatory landscape that put a lot of people at risk,\u201d he adds. \u201cA lot of people that take this are young people\u2014and right now it's sort of like an uncontrolled experiment.\u201d"

        "text": "Millions worldwide suffer from this debilitating disease. Symptoms vary widely, and there\u2019s no known cure. On-screen, Christina Applegate moved audiences to fits of laughter as a cynical widow on Dead to Me, but off-screen, her toes started tingling. Within months, she was in a wheelchair, the actress revealed in a recent interview with ABC News. Then came her multiple sclerosis diagnosis. But Applegate\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t stop there. Lesions in her brain caused pain all over her body. She began to experience depression, too. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy living\u2026I don\u2019t enjoy things anymore,\u201d Applegate said on the June 4 episode of her podcast, MeSsy. \u201cIt feels really fatalistic,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Around 2.9 million people worldwide\u2014roughly one million in the United States\u2014have multiple sclerosis or MS; Applegate and The Sopranos star Jamie-Lynn Sigler are two of them. In their podcast, the actresses speak candidly about their experiences with the disease. MS affects the central nervous system, the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks sheaths of a material called myelin that surround nerve fibers. Like insulation on wires, myelin protects nerves and helps transmit signals. But when myelin deteriorates, the nerve fibers underneath are exposed. This disrupts the brain\u2019s communication and leaves behind lesions, which can cause a myriad of symptoms as the disease progresses. But even several years before intense symptoms develop, the nervous system may already be under fire, says Riley Bove, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201c[The symptoms don\u2019t] quite make it to the threshold of someone going to the emergency room,\u201d she says, but things might not feel quite right. There\u2019s no definitive test for MS. Instead, the disease is diagnosed through clinical history and brain scans that reveal multiple lesions in different areas that formed at different times. MS impacts individual people in unique ways. \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one person with MS, then you\u2019ve [only] met one person with MS,\u201d explains Leigh Charvet, who directs MS research at New York University. Symptoms can vary widely, and much about the disease remains unknown. However, research is beginning to elucidate the disease's origins and potential treatments. MS is often categorized as relapsing-remitting, where symptoms go away and come back, or progressive, where they continually get worse. But Bove says this is a false dichotomy. \u201cEveryone experiences worsening symptoms because everybody is experiencing aging,\u201d she says. As our bodies age, we lose muscle mass and strength. On top of that, MS patients experience accelerated aging, Bove says, exacerbating these losses. Instead of focusing on the relapsing versus progressive dichotomy, she says it\u2019s more important to understand if the MS is active, where new lesions actively create symptoms. Ages 7-12 These symptoms may include numbness, slurred speech, vision issues, and loss of coordination, but others are less detectable. So-called invisible symptoms, like fatigue and bladder dysfunction, are more common and difficult to treat, says Charvet. Because these symptoms are also harder for those without MS to see, \u201cit\u2019s a burden to get support and empathy,\u201d says Bove. Depression, like Applegate described, is common with MS, with around half of patients experiencing it at some point after diagnosis. Depression can be from a reaction to news of the disease, but evidence also suggests that other factors play a role, like damage to the brain, says Mar\u00eda Gait\u00e1n, acting director of the Neuroimmunology Clinic at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland. There\u2019s no definitive cause of MS, but there is a prominent lead: the Epstein-Barr virus, known as EBV. In a study of over 10 million adults, the risk of developing MS increased by over 30 fold after EBV infection, researchers reported in Science back in 2022. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve likely already been infected by EBV. The virus spreads through saliva, and \u201cvirtually everyone has EBV,\u201d says Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and an author of the study. But that\u2019s not necessarily a cause for concern. The virus itself may be asymptomatic and fall dormant, and because about 90 percent of adults worldwide have had an EBV infection, the odds of developing MS remain about the same as the global average. Ascherio likens the connection between the virus and MS to the connection between smoking and cancer. \u201cSmoking causes lung cancer, but most smokers will never get lung cancer,\u201d he says. So, EBV could cause MS, but most people infected with EBV won\u2019t develop the disease. EBV may not be the one definitive cause of MS, but for now, it\u2019s the leading culprit. Beyond EBV infections, other factors may increase the risk of MS. Women are about three times more likely to get MS, and scientists don\u2019t know why. One theory is that women are more susceptible to autoimmune issues because of how responsive their immune systems must be to tolerate the foreign DNA of a fetus, Bove says. Sex chromosomes could also be related, but the answer \u201cis definitely not as easy as \u2018estrogen is good or bad,\u2019\u201d she says. (Learn more about why women might be more at risk of developing autoimmune diseases.)\u00a0 Blood relatives of those with MS are also more likely to develop the disease. This doesn\u2019t mean MS is inherited, but genetic variants associated with it could be. Smoking, obesity and vitamin D deficiency are also associated with MS. Although MS can be diagnosed at any age, it is most often diagnosed in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds. Previously, MS was thought to primarily affect white women. Only in the last 10 or 15 years has the paradigm started to shift, reflecting what scientists know to be true: The disease develops across all racial groups, Bove says. Because of this lingering stereotype of MS, \u201ca lot of people from different genders, races and ethnic backgrounds don't have the knowledge about MS in their communities, and that can be a barrier to getting help,\u201d she says. While some areas of the world have relatively low MS cases, like sub-Saharan Africa, this may be more because of a lack of neurologists than a lack of MS, Bove says. There\u2019s no known cure or way to guarantee you won\u2019t develop MS. For now, limiting risks by quitting smoking, eating healthy and getting enough Vitamin D is the best prevention measure, Gait\u00e1n says, but they\u2019re not surefire methods. Researchers have identified blood markers for neuroinflammation, and in the future, tests for these markers could help diagnose MS or detect imminent flare-ups, allowing patients to take medication before symptoms arise. Preventing EBV could also help. Vaccines for EBV are in early stages, and antivirals exist but have not seen much success in clinical testing. Ascherio believes MS cases could decrease significantly if an effective drug against EVB is developed.\u00a0 For now, medications can treat symptoms and prevent new lesions, but none repair past damage to the nervous system. \u201cThat\u2019s the next big thing on the horizon,\u201d Charvet says. Nothing is known to entirely prevent MS, but spreading awareness is an important step to catch the disease early. \u201cBe aware of the disease and know that if you diagnose and treat early, you change the evolution of the disease,\u201d Gait\u00e1n says.

        "title": "Is becoming a dad good for your health?",
        "text": "Fatherhood is no easy role, but psychologists say it comes with a host of mental and physical health advantages that benefit both dads and their offspring. The costs of fatherhood are well known: financial responsibilities and related stress, diminished sleep, and less free time. But there are also plenty of mental and physical upsides that come from taking on such a pivotal caregiving role.\u00a0 These include greater stores of empathy, improved longevity, and more happiness and meaning in life. \"Men also report\u00a0improvements in diet and exercise and less substance use after becoming fathers,\u201d says Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan, a psychology professor at Ohio State University and a fellow of the National Council on Family Relations.\u00a0\u201cAnd dads who are more involved with their children are more satisfied with their lives and are more connected with friends, family, and community.\" A present father can also provide unmatched benefits for the kids they are raising. \"Children who grow up with invested fathers have better social, emotional, and academic outcomes than children without such fathers,\" says Lee Gettler, a biological anthropologist and director of the Hormones, Health, and Human Behavior lab\u00a0at the University of Notre Dame. Of course, related upsides also apply to mothers and all committed guardians and caregivers, but in honor of Father's Day, it's appropriate to highlight the seemingly superhuman benefits that come from being a superhero dad.\u00a0 Parenthood can be great for a father's mental health by improving\u00a0feelings of compassion, increasing\u00a0life fulfillment, and by providing higher rates of satisfaction\u00a0with job performance and work/life balance.\u00a0 \"I and other researchers have consistently found that caring for and spending time with one\u2019s children is associated with emotional benefits for all parents, and especially for dads,\" says Katherine Nelson-Coffey, a behavioral scientist, researcher, and the director of the Social Connection & Positive Psychology lab at Arizona State University. Nelson-Coffey has measured these benefits across\u00a0multiple studies by comparing day-to-day activities in which men commonly engage while looking at who those activities were done with and what emotions were experienced during each one. \"We've consistently found that fathers report more positive emotions and a sense of meaning when they are spending time with their children compared to the other activities they do during the day,\" she explains. Ages 7-12 New fathers also experience a flood of happy hormones. \"We've\u00a0published research showing that fathers\u2019 oxytocin increases substantially when they first hold their babies shortly after they are born,\" says Gettler.\u00a0 Another noteworthy change that occurs when men become fathers is that, as they spend time with their infants and young children, they experience a decrease in testosterone. \"Higher testosterone focuses time and energy on mating efforts and competition, while lower testosterone shifts time and energy commitments towards partnering and parenting,\" says Gettler, who co-authored the first large longitudinal study measuring such changes.\u00a0 The resulting empathy and understanding stemming from these hormone changes are among the reasons that, \"on a behavioral level, anthropologists have been aware for a long time that those cultures where men live in close proximity to children tend to be less bellicose and less likely to initiate war,\" says Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, professor emerita at the University of California, Davis and author of the book, Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding. (This Father\u2019s Day, meet 6 extreme animal dads) Beyond hormonal changes, fathers also experience many positive emotions when their children say something amusing, learn a new skill, or show tender affection through words or hugs. \"Experiencing frequent positive emotions these ways are\u00a0important building blocks\u00a0for mental health and well-being,\" says Nelson-Coffey. In a supportive study that Nelson-Coffey co-authored and published this year, she showed fathers also experiencing a sense of gratitude that \"predicted greater life satisfaction and fewer negative emotions over time.\" Gettler points to\u00a0additional related research\u00a0that shows that \"partnered fathers who live with their children are also less likely to be depressed than single men without children.\" He says this is likely associated with the happy emotions that fathers frequently feel while caring for their children and because of the satisfaction some men experience when providing for their family's financial needs. Dads also often experience many new social opportunities because of their children such as meeting other adults through child-centered sports participation, parent-teacher conferences at school, playdate arrangements, and scouting. Karen Fingerman, a human development and family sciences professor at The University of Texas at Austin, says such opportunities are especially appreciated when a family moves to a new city. Supporting this, Nelson-Coffey points to\u00a0one of her parenting studies, which found that men with children experience a greater sense of social connection compared to men without children. She explains that when men feel connected to others, \"they are less likely to experience loneliness, which is a major risk factor for the development of depression and other mental health concerns.\"\u00a0 Beyond such mental and social advantages, fathers also experience many physical health benefits. For instance, studies show that men are more likely to avoid drugs and ditch harmful substances\u00a0like\u00a0tobacco\u00a0and\u00a0alcohol, in part, because \"young children help fathers to consider and prioritize what's most important in life,\" says Jay Fagan, professor emeritus at the school of social work at Temple University and the former co-director of the Fatherhood Research and Practice Network. Another\u00a0related outcome Fagan points to \u201cis a decrease in negative behaviors, fewer accidents, and less contact with the criminal justice system.\"\u00a0 Nelson-Coffey says that eating habits also often improve\u00a0as fathers work to model a balanced diet and healthier eating behaviors to encourage their children to do the same.\u00a0 Dads also commonly make more time to engage in physical activity and play with their kids\u2014interactions that benefit father and child alike. \"When fathers engage in physical exercise and make it fun and a habit to take\u00a0their kids, the kids also learn that exercising and staying healthy is fun and good for them,\" says Natasha Cabrera, professor of human development and quantitative methodology at the University of Maryland. And while there is\u00a0scientific evidence\u00a0that some men gain weight and what's often called the \"dad bod\" after becoming a father, Gettler notes that it's occurrence may sometimes be more cultural than related to parenting as he didn\u2019t find evidence of this occurring in another country in recent related research. Timing may also play a part in cases of new fathers packing on some extra weight. Nelson-Coffey notes that during the early years of fatherhood, fathers are more likely to be sleep deprived and are often less physically active, but that usually changes as their kids age and often because of their kids. \"So, although there may be a cost in the early years, parents may benefit physically as their kids get older,\" she says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of these physical health benefits help explain\u00a0several\u00a0studies\u00a0that show \"that fathers live longer than men without children, even controlling for marital status,\" says Jason Carroll, the Wheatley Institute's family initiative director at Brigham Young University in Utah.\u00a0 Efforts to be more physically fit and eat better likely occur because fatherhood ushers in greater life meaning for many men. \"Becoming a father often gives men an expanded vision and a new sense of identity and purpose\u2014changing a man's priorities in life and giving him a sense that his choices matter,\" says Carroll. Of course, even when certain mental and physical health outcomes are better for dads when compared to non-dads, fatherhood is an exceptionally demanding role that can be its own source of enormous stress. \"Fathers can\u00a0suffer from depression\u00a0because parenting is intense and difficult as much as it is joyous and rewarding,\" says Cabrera.\u00a0 She points out that becoming a new father\u00a0can also be intimidating and overwhelming\u00a0for many dads, and that relationships with teenage children can be especially fraught with tension. When navigating these uncharted waters, many fathers experience high levels of anxiety and self-doubt. \"Fathers also often\u00a0feel the responsibility\u00a0to work harder and longer hours to support their children, which can put a lot of strain on\u00a0their physical health,\" she adds.\u00a0 Children can also distract away from quality time with one's partner and be a strain on one's marriage, notes Nelson-Coffey.\u00a0 Because of such factors, \"it's important for all parents, including fathers, to pay attention to how they are feeling, both mentally and physically, and to take steps to strengthen their health,\" advises Schoppe-Sullivan. While it may feel tempting or unavoidable to neglect one's wellbeing, she says, getting enough sleep and exercise and planning plenty of \"you time\" is still crucial. \"Healthy parents make better parents and better partners.\" Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

When navigating these uncharted waters, many fathers experience high levels of anxiety and self-doubt.\n\n\"Fathers also often feel the responsibility to work harder and longer hours to support their children, which can put a lot of strain on their physical health,\" she adds.\n\nChildren can also distract away from quality time with one's partner and be a strain on one's marriage, notes Nelson-Coffey.\n\nBecause of such factors, \"it's important for all parents, including fathers, to pay attention to how they are feeling, both mentally and physically, and to take steps to strengthen their health,\" advises Schoppe-Sullivan. While it may feel tempting or unavoidable to neglect one's wellbeing, she says, getting enough sleep and exercise and planning plenty of \"you time\" is still crucial. \"Healthy parents make better parents and better partners.\""

        "title": "Why health advocates are concerned about a chemical in your decaf",
        "text": "Activists are petitioning the FDA to ban a harmful chemical used to remove caffeine from coffee. But experts say you don't need to panic. As more and more people turn to decaffeinated coffee, either due to health concerns or personal preference, there\u2019s growing scrutiny of the methods that are used to remove caffeine from coffee beans\u2014and their health implications. Environmental activist groups have recently petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to consider a ban on a chemical that is popularly used to make decaf coffee. Called methylene chloride, the chemical was recently banned for industrial use by the Environmental Protection Agency, due to the fact that it can cause certain cancers, as well as neurotoxicity, liver damage, and sometimes death. \u201cThere are alternatives,\u201d says Jaclyn Bowen, the executive director of the Clean Label Project, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for replacing the use of methylene chloride to decaffeinate coffee with other options. (How the health benefits of decaf compare to regular coffee.) But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your decaf habit is in jeopardy. Here\u2019s what to know about methylene chloride\u2014and the alternatives that already exist. To decaffeinate coffee, you need some type of solvent. Soaking coffee beans in a hot mixture of the solvent helps extract the caffeine molecules\u2014leaving behind decaffeinated coffee once the solvent is removed. \u00a0 \u201cThere are basically four main solvents that are used,\u201d says Meredith Worthington, the executive editor for ConsumerLabs.com. These include methylene chloride, which is also called the European method, and is the most widely used method; ethyl acetate, which is sometimes called the \u201cnatural solvent,\u201d due to the fact that it is present in a number of fruits, such as bananas and sugarcane; the Swiss water method, which uses hot water to extract the caffeine; and the carbon dioxide method, which uses liquid carbon dioxide. Depending on the method, this can affect the taste, as well as the chemical composition of the coffee.\u00a0\u00a0 Methylene chloride has long been the most widely used method, with the Food and Drug Administration mandating that the remaining levels in decaf coffee cannot exceed 10 parts per million. And independent testing of coffee brands has consistently found levels of methylene chloride that are below the FDA limits. (\"Forever chemicals\" are hiding in your kitchen. Here's where.) Not everyone agrees that methylene chloride should be banned for decaffeinating coffee. As the National Coffee Association wrote in a recent press release, \u201cThe overwhelming weight of scientific evidence shows that drinking European Method decaf\u2014like all coffee\u2014is associated with significant health benefits, including longer lives and reduced risk of multiple cancers and chronic diseases.\u201d Still, Worthington says, \u201cSome people just don\u2019t like that, especially when there are other methods that exist that would result in no concerning solvents. There are a number of companies that only use water in their extraction.\u201d\u00a0 Another major concern by advocates is the fact that many of the people who are turning to decaffeinated coffee are already more vulnerable to the effects of trace chemicals. This includes pregnant women and people with health conditions, who may decide to switch to decaf for health reasons. As a result, alternatives like the Swiss water method are becoming increasingly used by major coffee companies, such as Peet\u2019s Coffee, due to consumer concerns.\u00a0 In addition to the concerns about the use of methylene chloride to decaffeinate coffee, there may be some subtle differences in health benefits, depending on which process has been used. ConsumerLabs.com has done testing on the effect of the different types of decaffeination process on green tea, which uses the same processes as coffee beans. \u201cWhat we found was that brands that decaffeinated the tea using ethyl acetate tended to have lower levels of EGCG, which is considered to be the active constituent of green tea, thought to give it its health benefits,\u201d Worthington says.\u00a0\u201cPresumably, the same issue would exist for coffee as well.\u201d (How coffee helps forests grow faster.) In another study, published in 2010, researchers looked at the levels of a type of antioxidant that is found in coffee, called phenols. They found that antioxidant levels in decaf coffee did vary according to which extraction method was used, although not by a huge margin. Decaf coffee that was prepared using the Swiss water method or methylene chloride resulted in slightly lower levels of phenols than using ethyl acetate or liquid carbon dioxide. However, in all of these methods, decaf retained more than 80 percent of the original antioxidant levels compared to regular coffee.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In the meantime, people who want to know how their preferred brand of coffee is decaffeinated can check the website CheckYourDecaf.org, or reach out to the coffee company.\u00a0As Bowen notes, the Clean Label Project is also pushing for coffee companies to list the type of decaffeination process used on their labels, so that consumers can make an informed decision.

        "title": "Becoming a dad comes with a lot of changes\u2014including to your health",
        "text": "Fatherhood is no easy role, but psychologists say it comes with a host of mental and physical health advantages that benefit both dads and their offspring. The costs of fatherhood are well known: financial responsibilities and related stress, diminished sleep, and less free time. But there are also plenty of mental and physical upsides that come from taking on such a pivotal caregiving role.\u00a0 These include greater stores of empathy, improved longevity, and more happiness and meaning in life. \"Men also report\u00a0improvements in diet and exercise and less substance use after becoming fathers,\u201d says Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan, a psychology professor at Ohio State University and a fellow of the National Council on Family Relations.\u00a0\u201cAnd dads who are more involved with their children are more satisfied with their lives and are more connected with friends, family, and community.\" A present father can also provide unmatched benefits for the kids they are raising. \"Children who grow up with invested fathers have better social, emotional, and academic outcomes than children without such fathers,\" says Lee Gettler, a biological anthropologist and director of the Hormones, Health, and Human Behavior lab\u00a0at the University of Notre Dame. Of course, related upsides also apply to mothers and all committed guardians and caregivers, but in honor of Father's Day, it's appropriate to highlight the seemingly superhuman benefits that come from being a superhero dad.\u00a0 Parenthood can be great for a father's mental health by improving\u00a0feelings of compassion, increasing\u00a0life fulfillment, and by providing higher rates of satisfaction\u00a0with job performance and work/life balance.\u00a0 \"I and other researchers have consistently found that caring for and spending time with one\u2019s children is associated with emotional benefits for all parents, and especially for dads,\" says Katherine Nelson-Coffey, a behavioral scientist, researcher, and the director of the Social Connection & Positive Psychology lab at Arizona State University. Nelson-Coffey has measured these benefits across\u00a0multiple studies by comparing day-to-day activities in which men commonly engage while looking at who those activities were done with and what emotions were experienced during each one. \"We've consistently found that fathers report more positive emotions and a sense of meaning when they are spending time with their children compared to the other activities they do during the day,\" she explains. Ages 7-12 New fathers also experience a flood of happy hormones. \"We've\u00a0published research showing that fathers\u2019 oxytocin increases substantially when they first hold their babies shortly after they are born,\" says Gettler.\u00a0 Another noteworthy change that occurs when men become fathers is that, as they spend time with their infants and young children, they experience a decrease in testosterone. \"Higher testosterone focuses time and energy on mating efforts and competition, while lower testosterone shifts time and energy commitments towards partnering and parenting,\" says Gettler, who co-authored the first large longitudinal study measuring such changes.\u00a0 The resulting empathy and understanding stemming from these hormone changes are among the reasons that, \"on a behavioral level, anthropologists have been aware for a long time that those cultures where men live in close proximity to children tend to be less bellicose and less likely to initiate war,\" says Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, professor emerita at the University of California, Davis and author of the book, Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding. (This Father\u2019s Day, meet 6 extreme animal dads) Beyond hormonal changes, fathers also experience many positive emotions when their children say something amusing, learn a new skill, or show tender affection through words or hugs. \"Experiencing frequent positive emotions these ways are\u00a0important building blocks\u00a0for mental health and well-being,\" says Nelson-Coffey. In a supportive study that Nelson-Coffey co-authored and published this year, she showed fathers also experiencing a sense of gratitude that \"predicted greater life satisfaction and fewer negative emotions over time.\" Gettler points to\u00a0additional related research\u00a0that shows that \"partnered fathers who live with their children are also less likely to be depressed than single men without children.\" He says this is likely associated with the happy emotions that fathers frequently feel while caring for their children and because of the satisfaction some men experience when providing for their family's financial needs. Dads also often experience many new social opportunities because of their children such as meeting other adults through child-centered sports participation, parent-teacher conferences at school, playdate arrangements, and scouting. Karen Fingerman, a human development and family sciences professor at The University of Texas at Austin, says such opportunities are especially appreciated when a family moves to a new city. Supporting this, Nelson-Coffey points to\u00a0one of her parenting studies, which found that men with children experience a greater sense of social connection compared to men without children. She explains that when men feel connected to others, \"they are less likely to experience loneliness, which is a major risk factor for the development of depression and other mental health concerns.\"\u00a0 Beyond such mental and social advantages, fathers also experience many physical health benefits. For instance, studies show that men are more likely to avoid drugs and ditch harmful substances\u00a0like\u00a0tobacco\u00a0and\u00a0alcohol, in part, because \"young children help fathers to consider and prioritize what's most important in life,\" says Jay Fagan, professor emeritus at the school of social work at Temple University and the former co-director of the Fatherhood Research and Practice Network. Another\u00a0related outcome Fagan points to \u201cis a decrease in negative behaviors, fewer accidents, and less contact with the criminal justice system.\"\u00a0 Nelson-Coffey says that eating habits also often improve\u00a0as fathers work to model a balanced diet and healthier eating behaviors to encourage their children to do the same.\u00a0 Dads also commonly make more time to engage in physical activity and play with their kids\u2014interactions that benefit father and child alike. \"When fathers engage in physical exercise and make it fun and a habit to take\u00a0their kids, the kids also learn that exercising and staying healthy is fun and good for them,\" says Natasha Cabrera, professor of human development and quantitative methodology at the University of Maryland. And while there is\u00a0scientific evidence\u00a0that some men gain weight and what's often called the \"dad bod\" after becoming a father, Gettler notes that it's occurrence may sometimes be more cultural than related to parenting as he didn\u2019t find evidence of this occurring in another country in recent related research. Timing may also play a part in cases of new fathers packing on some extra weight. Nelson-Coffey notes that during the early years of fatherhood, fathers are more likely to be sleep deprived and are often less physically active, but that usually changes as their kids age and often because of their kids. \"So, although there may be a cost in the early years, parents may benefit physically as their kids get older,\" she says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of these physical health benefits help explain\u00a0several\u00a0studies\u00a0that show \"that fathers live longer than men without children, even controlling for marital status,\" says Jason Carroll, the Wheatley Institute's family initiative director at Brigham Young University in Utah.\u00a0 Efforts to be more physically fit and eat better likely occur because fatherhood ushers in greater life meaning for many men. \"Becoming a father often gives men an expanded vision and a new sense of identity and purpose\u2014changing a man's priorities in life and giving him a sense that his choices matter,\" says Carroll. Of course, even when certain mental and physical health outcomes are better for dads when compared to non-dads, fatherhood is an exceptionally demanding role that can be its own source of enormous stress. \"Fathers can\u00a0suffer from depression\u00a0because parenting is intense and difficult as much as it is joyous and rewarding,\" says Cabrera.\u00a0 She points out that becoming a new father\u00a0can also be intimidating and overwhelming\u00a0for many dads, and that relationships with teenage children can be especially fraught with tension.

        "title": "It's hard to reconnect with old friends. Science may have a solution.",
        "text": "Rekindling old friendships can be mentally and emotionally beneficial, yet when it comes to that first message to bridge the distance, most of us just can\u2019t hit the send button. Hearing from an old friend you\u2019ve lost touch with can be a pleasant surprise, and reviving those old friendships can be extremely fulfilling. Psychologists have long noted the benefits of more friendships and more diverse friendships. But according to a new study by psychologists from Simon Fraser University and University of Sussex, we often hesitate to initiate those reconnections. The study included seven large surveys of almost 2,500 participants. Over 90 percent of participants in the first survey could think of a particular friend with whom they had lost touch and would like to speak with again. However, even when participants expressed wanting to reconnect, thought the friend would be appreciative, and were given time to draft a message, only about a third actually sent the message. To understand this reluctance, the researchers had participants in another survey rate their willingness to complete various tasks at that moment, including reaching out to a friend they had lost touch with, talking to a stranger, eating an ice cream bar, and picking up a garbage bag. Participants were about as willing to reach out to an old friend as they were to start a conversation with a stranger\u2014or to pick up a bag of garbage. The researchers then tried to encourage connection by mentioning previous research showing messages from old friends tend to be well-received. But this intervention did little to ease reluctance, and the number of participants who sent messages remained low. \u201cWe came to the conclusion that trying to change people\u2019s minds might not be the best strategy,\u201d says Lara Aknin, psychologist at Simon Fraser University and lead researcher on the study. \u201cInstead of changing people\u2019s minds, we really tried to change their behavior.\u201d Their new approach had participants practice with a \u201cwarm-up\u201d: One group spent three minutes writing messages to current friends and acquaintances, while another group spent three minutes browsing social media. Then, everyone was asked to draft and send a message to an old friend. Ages 7-12 The practice task proved successful: 53 percent of those who \u201cwarmed up\u201d ultimately sending the message\u2014a two-thirds increase over those who had not \u201cwarmed up.\u201d Only 31 percent of those in the social media group reached out to an old friend. So why is this such an obstacle that we need to warm up to overcome? Over time, old friends can start to feel like strangers, explains Aknin. That psychological distance is what people report as their main hurdle to reconnecting. (9 simple ways to boost your mental health, according to science) The type of relationship two friends had before losing touch can also determine how difficult this distance feels to bridge, according to Giuseppe Labianca, psychologist at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the study. A previously close relationship with a lot of trust makes picking up where you left off more likely and lessens the fear of rejection.

But Labianca says while social media might foster keeping up with old friends on a surface level, fully reactivating an old tie calls for a real conversation: A phone call or a face-to-face interaction, reacting to each other in real time. If you want to reach out to an old friend but are feeling hesitant, Aknin points out you\u2019re not the only one\u2014in fact, you're in the majority.

        "onlytext": "Hearing from an old friend you\u2019ve lost touch with can be a pleasant surprise, and reviving those old friendships can be extremely fulfilling. Psychologists have long noted the benefits of more friendships and more diverse friendships. But according to a new study by psychologists from Simon Fraser University and University of Sussex, we often hesitate to initiate those reconnections. The study included seven large surveys of almost 2,500 participants. Over 90 percent of participants in the first survey could think of a particular friend with whom they had lost touch and would like to speak with again. However, even when participants expressed wanting to reconnect, thought the friend would be appreciative, and were given time to draft a message, only about a third actually sent the message.\n\nTo understand this reluctance, the researchers had participants in another survey rate their willingness to complete various tasks at that moment, including reaching out to a friend they had lost touch with, talking to a stranger, eating an ice cream bar, and picking up a garbage bag. Participants were about as willing to reach out to an old friend as they were to start a conversation with a stranger\u2014or to pick up a bag of garbage.\n\nThe researchers then tried to encourage connection by mentioning previous research showing messages from old friends tend to be well-received. But this intervention did little to ease reluctance, and the number of participants who sent messages remained low. \u201cWe came to the conclusion that trying to change people\u2019s minds might not be the best strategy,\u201d says Lara Aknin, psychologist at Simon Fraser University and lead researcher on the study. \u201cInstead of changing people\u2019s minds, we really tried to change their behavior.\u201d\n\nTheir new approach had participants practice with a \u201cwarm-up\u201d: One group spent three minutes writing messages to current friends and acquaintances, while another group spent three minutes browsing social media. Then, everyone was asked to draft and send a message to an old friend. The practice task proved successful: 53 percent of those who \u201cwarmed up\u201d ultimately sending the message\u2014a two-thirds increase over those who had not \u201cwarmed up.\u201d Only 31 percent of those in the social media group reached out to an old friend.\n\nSo why is this such an obstacle that we need to warm up to overcome? Over time, old friends can start to feel like strangers, explains Aknin. That psychological distance is what people report as their main hurdle to reconnecting. The type of relationship two friends had before losing touch can also determine how difficult this distance feels to bridge, according to Giuseppe Labianca, psychologist at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the study. A previously close relationship with a lot of trust makes picking up where you left off more likely and lessens the fear of rejection.\n\nOur fear of rejection and awkwardness may be making us overly cautious, says Aknin.

        "title": "Does being the oldest or youngest sibling really shape your personality?",
        "text": "The psychological debate about sibling order has persisted for decades\u2014but it might be time to break up with the popular theory. Are you a responsible oldest child, an overlooked middle, or a free-wheeling baby? For those who adhere to the theory that birth order influences personality, the answer to that question may hold the key to who you are as a person. At parties, family dinners, and therapy sessions, people can use birth order as a kind of shorthand for personality traits\u2014an only child\u2019s selfishness, perhaps, or a middle child\u2019s struggle for visibility. But though your personal experiences may very well indicate that birth order forms the personalities around you, psychologists beg to differ. Here\u2019s why it might be time to drop the stereotypes. The idea that birth order influences a child\u2019s personality might be as old as people themselves. After all, various societies have long privileged\u2014or overlooked\u2014people based on where they stand in their family. In many ancient societies, for example, the arrival of a first child\u2014and thus a parent\u2019s transition to the head of a family\u2014often translated to a higher social status. It also gave rise to ceremonies like special baths for first-time mothers in Micronesia and the traditional pidyon haben\u00a0ceremony in Judaism, during which a first-born son is \u201credeemed\u201d by paying five silver coins to a priest. (Siblings can have surprisingly different DNA ancestry. Here's why.) Birth order has also long determined inheritance rights and royal lines of succession, as in the British monarchy which has long demanded a first-born \u201cheir\u201d and one or more \u201cspares\u201d as backups should something happen to the heir. Ages 7-12 But the psychological theory of birth order didn\u2019t develop until the early 20th century, when psychologist Alfred Adler theorized that birth order influenced not just social status, but a child\u2019s development and personality. Known as the father of individual psychology, Adler theorized that an individual\u2019s \u201cfamily constellation\u201d results in predictable personality traits. \u201cThe position in the family leaves an indelible stamp upon the individual\u2019s life style,\u201d Adler wrote in 1931. According to Adler, the birth of a sibling deprives oldest children of their parents\u2019 undivided attention\u2014and as a result they are neurotic, more prone to conservatism, and inclined to imitate their elders. Second children are competitive attention-grabbers, while youngest children are pampered and lazy. Finally, he theorized that people who grow up without siblings have a \u201cmother complex\u201d and are in rivalry with their father. Famous for his international lectures, popular psychology texts, and psychotherapeutic techniques, Adler\u2019s influence still resounds throughout the field of psychology\u2014and as a result, generations of psychologists undertook research that attempted to prove his theory of birth order. Studies conducted since Adler\u2019s time have found associations between birth order and everything from educational attainment to sexuality to middle children\u2019s success in team sports. Frank Sulloway, one of the theory\u2019s most prominent modern advocates, looked at adults and their careers in the 1990s and 2000s to assess the influence of birth order. He found a tendency for conservative research among famous firstborn scientists, with more radical research, such as the theory of evolution and relativity, more common among famous scientists born later in their family order. He also found differences between military and political strategies among militant firstborns like Maximilien Robespierre and moderate, nonviolent methods among famous middle-borns. But the studies that most applicable to personality development look at the \u201cbig five\u201d personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. And more recent birth order studies throw cold water on the theory that your birth order can shape your personality. (Not an extrovert or an introvert? There's a word for that.) Rodica Damian, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Houston, conducted one of the largest such studies in 2015, using data from a longitudinal study of over 440,000 U.S. high school students. After controlling for socioeconomic status, sex, and age, the study showed that \u201cthe association between birth order and personality traits is as close to zero as you can get,\u201d she says. Another 2015 study underscored Damian\u2019s findings: After analyzing three nationally representative samples from the U.S., Great Britain, and Germany, researchers wrote \u201cwe consistently found no birth-order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination.\u201d But both teams of researchers found evidence for one trait that would please firstborn children (and dismay their younger siblings): The studies each showed that firstborns were slightly more likely to have high verbal intelligence. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that firstborns are smarter or learn more easily, Damian says. More likely it\u2019s because firstborns spend more time around adults in their early childhood\u2014and she points out that in her study, the difference was a matter of a single IQ point. Overall, the other study team wrote, \u201cwe must conclude that birth order does not have a lasting effect on broad personality traits outside of the intellectual domain.\u201d As a scientist, Damian is cautious about claiming that any theory has been \u201cdisproven.\u201d However, she says that modern research essentially debunks the theory that birth order affects personality\u2014which she calls a \u201czombie theory\u201d because it just won\u2019t die. So why does the idea still enchant the public\u2014and why do researchers continue to plumb the question?\u2028 \u201cEverybody has an opinion on it because everybody has a birth order, even only children,\u201d says Damian. And part of the reason we just can\u2019t quit birth order psychology may have to do with our own experiences that will always appear to support it. Older children will always seem to be more responsible and sophisticated than their younger siblings because they are more developmentally mature. (How much does your name influence your future? It might surprise you.) \u201cEven though you see this and it's true, you don't have a magic lens to go back in time and observe the children at the [exact] same age,\u201d Damian explains. It\u2019s a \u201cperfect confound,\u201d she and her colleagues write\u2014and it\u2019s \u201cone circumstance where personal experience will be wrong and the truth can only be discovered through good scientific reasoning and investigation.\u201d In truth, the science of personality development is anything but settled. Modern research using twin studies suggests that personality formation is about 40 percent due to genetics. The rest may be a matter of a complex combination of environment and cultural practices that help shape the disposition with which we\u2019re born. Though researchers can measure the \u201cbig five\u201d personality traits, it\u2019s harder to quantify the subjective experiences that shape our everyday lives and, perhaps, our personalities. Damian is currently studying the possible effects of people\u2019s life narratives\u2014the stories they tell themselves about their own experiences\u2014on the people they become. But for much of the public, teasing out the complex web of nature and nurture is far less fun than teasing our siblings.

        "title": "Birth control options for men are advancing. Here\u2019s how they work.",
        "text": "From gels and pills to implants, the contraceptive choices accessible to most men may soon expand beyond condoms and vasectomies. When hormonal contraceptive pills hit the market in the 1960s, it revolutionized women\u2019s control over their own bodies. The pill gave women the freedom to choose when they want to start a family, but unintended pregnancies are still common. Nearly half of the pregnancies that occur every year are unintended, both in the U.S. and around the world. Could a contraceptive for men help?\u00a0 We might find out in the next decade. Scientists are successfully experimenting with pills, gels, and implants that would allow men to share contraceptive responsibility with women. Many are more convenient and foolproof than condoms or easily reversed than vasectomies, and some are being developed without the hormones that typically cause bothersome side effects for women.\u00a0 \u201cI see it as a huge shift in equity, \u201d says Heather Vadhat, the executive director of the Male Contraceptive Initiative, an organization that funds contraceptive research. Understanding how these new birth control methods work requires a refresher on the male reproductive system. \u00a0\u00a0 For men, successful reproduction begins with the right cocktail of hormones, notably testosterone. They signal the body to start producing sperm, a process called spermatogenesis. It takes about 74 days for sperm to develop and mature, a regeneration process that\u2019s constantly taking place after a man reaches puberty. Mature sperm are stored in the testes, a reserve of reproductive material that\u2019s regularly restocked.\u00a0 When a man ejaculates, more than 250 million sperm leave the testicles and begin their hunt for an egg to fertilize. If they find themselves inside a vagina, the best swimmers propel themselves forward, through the vagina, past the cervix, and into the uterus where, if they stumble upon a healthy, fertile egg, they lead to conception.\u00a0 While modern female birth control uses hormones to disrupt the process that produces one to two fertile eggs a month, male birth control must stop millions of sperm in their tracks.\u00a0 Ages 7-12 Hormones are being used to stop the male reproductive process by specifically targeting spermatogenesis, slowly shutting down the sperm production process.\u00a0 Early clinical trials are showing promising results from a topical gel applied daily to the shoulders. More than 200 men applied the gel daily, and after 15 weeks, 86 percent had sperm counts low enough to make the gel an effective contraceptive. The gel contains a synthetic female hormone called progestin that lowers testosterone, a male reproductive hormone, to a level where sperm production is inhibited. As the gel is absorbed into the skin, small amounts remain just underneath, slowly releasing contraceptive hormones that make the man infertile for as long as he continues to use the gel.\u00a0 The gel also contains a small amount of testosterone that\u2019s added back into the body to maintain mens' other normal body functions.\u00a0 One 2012 clinical trial tested the gel in 99 men and found that almost 90 percent of them experienced temporary infertility. Participants reported side effects similar to female hormonal birth control, such as weight gain, acne, low libido, and mood swings. Hormonal gels are already used to treat hormone deficiencies, which is one reason the method is appealing to researchers\u2014they know men are already willing to use the application method. Future trials will test the gel's safety and reversibility. Vasectomies are another option for male birth control. They have been performed since the late 19th century, but became more popular during the 20th. The procedure is named for small tubes in the scrotum called the vas deferens. When sperm leaves the testes, it travels down these tubes and mixes with semen. Vasectomies work by blocking this pathway in the vas deferens, preventing the sperm from leaving the body. Often doctors will surgically insert a special clip to block the tubes, or they might cut and tie the vas deferens tubes directly.\u00a0 In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ensured women could access abortion care, doctors have seen an increase in men looking for vasectomies.\u00a0 \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re seeing is men thinking they can reverse vasectomies when they want,\u201d says Vahdat. \u201cBut a vasectomy is pretty straightforward, and reversal is not.\u201d\u00a0 Depending on how the vasectomy is reversed, there\u2019s anywhere from a 60 to 90 percent chance\u00a0fertility can be regained, but the process requires surgery and success isn\u2019t guaranteed. There may be new options on the horizon. Vahdat is excited about a company called Contraline that injects a gel into the vas deferens. The gel is meant to block sperm, just like traditional vasectomies, but over time the gel liquifies and is absorbed into the body. The gel is in early clinical trials in Australia, and the participating men will be evaluated for the next three years. After sperm are produced, tunneled through the vas deferens, and deposited in the vagina, they must still swim their hearts out to successfully cause a pregnancy.\u00a0 But a study published earlier this year in Nature Communications shows promise for an \u201con-demand\u201d contraceptive pill that could be taken about 30 minutes before intercourse and whose effects would wear off after about a day. The drug works by targeting an enzyme called Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), essentially the \u201con switch\u201d that tells sperm to start swimming. When that enzyme is suppressed, sperm can\u2019t get any farther than the vagina.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019ll be immotile; they\u2019ll just sit there and twitch,\u201d says Lonny Levin, a pharmacologist at Weill Cornell and one of the study\u2019s authors.\u00a0 When an experimental drug was given to mice, they were infertile after 15 minutes. Two hours later, their fertility returned to normal.\u00a0 \u201cI said holy mackerel this is the holy grail. This is a male contraceptive,\u201d Levin says.\u00a0 After about an hour inside the vagina, the sperm die and pregnancy is averted.\u00a0 Levin and his research partners hope to test these enzyme blockers on humans in the next two to three years and think it could still be a decade until those trials produce results that ready the pill for market. \u201cThere was a stereotype that men won\u2019t use [birth control], and women won\u2019t trust them,\u201d says Vahdat.\u00a0 But a survey shared at a World Health Organization webinar in September 2022 (seen in a recording here) suggests that\u2019s not entirely true. A global survey of 5,000 men who have sex with women showed many were interested in trying a contraceptive. The least enthusiastic participants were found in the U.S.\u2014about 40 percent of men in the U.S. said they would try birth control in the next year. And the most excited were in Nigeria\u2014nearly 80 percent of men said they were interested in taking a new form of male contraception.\u00a0 Steve Kretschmer, executive director of consulting firm DesireLine, conducted the survey. He said countries where women\u2019s contraceptives were already common had men who were slightly less interested in taking birth control. But overall, in all countries surveyed, men's interest increased over time.\u00a0 His data also showed that a majority of women in each country said they would believe their male partner if he told them they were taking birth control.\u00a0 Vahdat is eager for these new contraceptives, reproductive advancements that have been a long time coming. Among her peers, she says, there\u2019s a running joke that birth control for men has been \u201ca couple years away for 50 years.\u201d But, she adds, it finally feels within reach.\u00a0 When male birth control is widely available, Vahdat expects it to dramatically reframe how we think about reproduction and who\u2019s responsible for it.\u00a0 \u201cWe just don\u2019t think of men as contraceptive beings. It\u2019s so synonymous with female autonomy,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel confident it\u2019s going to be game-changing.\u201d\u00a0 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The pill gave women the freedom to choose when they want to start a family, but unintended pregnancies are still common. Nearly half of the pregnancies that occur every year are unintended, both in the U.S. and around the world. Could a contraceptive for men help? \n\nWe might find out in the next decade. Scientists are successfully experimenting with pills, gels, and implants that would allow men to share contraceptive responsibility with women. Many are more convenient and foolproof than condoms or easily reversed than vasectomies, and some are being developed without the hormones that typically cause bothersome side effects for women. \n\n\u201cI see it as a huge shift in equity, \u201d says Heather Vadhat, the executive director of the Male Contraceptive Initiative, an organization that funds contraceptive research. Understanding how these new birth control methods work requires a refresher on the male reproductive system. \n\nFor men, successful reproduction begins with the right cocktail of hormones, notably testosterone. They signal the body to start producing sperm, a process called spermatogenesis. It takes about 74 days for sperm to develop and mature, a regeneration process that\u2019s constantly taking place after a man reaches puberty. Mature sperm are stored in the testes, a reserve of reproductive material that\u2019s regularly restocked. \n\nWhen a man ejaculates, more than 250 million sperm leave the testicles and begin their hunt for an egg to fertilize. If they find themselves inside a vagina, the best swimmers propel themselves forward, through the vagina, past the cervix, and into the uterus where, if they stumble upon a healthy, fertile egg, they lead to conception. \n\nWhile modern female birth control uses hormones to disrupt the process that produces one to two fertile eggs a month, male birth control must stop millions of sperm in their tracks. \n\nAges 7-12 Hormones are being used to stop the male reproductive process by specifically targeting spermatogenesis, slowly shutting down the sperm production process. \n\nEarly clinical trials are showing promising results from a topical gel applied daily to the shoulders. More than 200 men applied the gel daily, and after 15 weeks, 86 percent had sperm counts low enough to make the gel an effective contraceptive. The gel contains a synthetic female hormone called progestin that lowers testosterone, a male reproductive hormone, to a level where sperm production is inhibited. As the gel is absorbed into the skin, small amounts remain just underneath, slowly releasing contraceptive hormones that make the man infertile for as long as he continues to use the gel. \n\nThe gel also contains a small amount of testosterone that\u2019s added back into the body to maintain mens' other normal body functions. \n\nOne 2012 clinical trial tested the gel in 99 men and found that almost 90 percent of them experienced temporary infertility. Participants reported side effects similar to female hormonal birth control, such as weight gain, acne, low libido, and mood swings. Hormonal gels are already used to treat hormone deficiencies, which is one reason the method is appealing to researchers\u2014they know men are already willing to use the application method. Future trials will test the gel's safety and reversibility. \n\nVasectomies are another option for male birth control. They have been performed since the late 19th century, but became more popular during the 20th. The procedure is named for small tubes in the scrotum called the vas deferens. When sperm leaves the testes, it travels down these tubes and mixes with semen. Vasectomies work by blocking this pathway in the vas deferens, preventing the sperm from leaving the body. Often doctors will surgically insert a special clip to block the tubes, or they might cut and tie the vas deferens tubes directly. \n\nIn the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ensured women could access abortion care, doctors have seen an increase in men looking for vasectomies. \n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re seeing is men thinking they can reverse vasectomies when they want,\u201d says Vahdat. \u201cBut a vasectomy is pretty straightforward, and reversal is not.\u201d \n\nDepending on how the vasectomy is reversed, there\u2019s anywhere from a 60 to 90 percent chance fertility can be regained, but the process requires surgery and success isn\u2019t guaranteed. There may be new options on the horizon. Vahdat is excited about a company called Contraline that injects a gel into the vas deferens. The gel is meant to block sperm, just like traditional vasectomies, but over time the gel liquifies and is absorbed into the body. The gel is in early clinical trials in Australia, and the participating men will be evaluated for the next three years. \n\nAfter sperm are produced, tunneled through the vas deferens, and deposited in the vagina, they must still swim their hearts out to successfully cause a pregnancy. \n\nBut a study published earlier this year in Nature Communications shows promise for an \u201con-demand\u201d contraceptive pill that could be taken about 30 minutes before intercourse and whose effects would wear off after about a day. The drug works by targeting an enzyme called Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), essentially the \u201con switch\u201d that tells sperm to start swimming. When that enzyme is suppressed, sperm can\u2019t get any farther than the vagina. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be immotile; they\u2019ll just sit there and twitch,\u201d says Lonny Levin, a pharmacologist at Weill Cornell and one of the study\u2019s authors. \n\nWhen an experimental drug was given to mice, they were infertile after 15 minutes. Two hours later, their fertility returned to normal. \n\n\u201cI said holy mackerel this is the holy grail. This is a male contraceptive,\u201d Levin says. \n\nAfter about an hour inside the vagina, the sperm die and pregnancy is averted. \n\nLevin and his research partners hope to test these enzyme blockers on humans in the next two to three years and think it could still be a decade until those trials produce results that ready the pill for market. \n\n\u201cThere was a stereotype that men won\u2019t use [birth control], and women won\u2019t trust them,\u201d says Vahdat. \n\nBut a survey shared at a World Health Organization webinar in September 2022 suggests that\u2019s not entirely true. A global survey of 5,000 men who have sex with women showed many were interested in trying a contraceptive. The least enthusiastic participants were found in the U.S.\u2014about 40 percent of men in the U.S. said they would try birth control in the next year. And the most excited were in Nigeria\u2014nearly 80 percent of men said they were interested in taking a new form of male contraception. \n\nSteve Kretschmer, executive director of consulting firm DesireLine, conducted the survey. He said countries where women\u2019s contraceptives were already common had men who were slightly less interested in taking birth control. But overall, in all countries surveyed, men's interest increased over time. \n\nHis data also showed that a majority of women in each country said they would believe their male partner if he told them they were taking birth control. \n\nVahdat is eager for these new contraceptives, reproductive advancements that have been a long time coming. Among her peers, she says, there\u2019s a running joke that birth control for men has been \u201ca couple years away for 50 years.\u201d But, she adds, it finally feels within reach. \n\nWhen male birth control is widely available, Vahdat expects it to dramatically reframe how we think about reproduction and who\u2019s responsible for it. \n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t think of men as contraceptive beings. It\u2019s so synonymous with female autonomy,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel confident it\u2019s going to be game-changing.\u201d"

And these are fundamental not only to living a longer life, but also to living a more active life for longer. Even before we are born our bodies may be susceptible to a particular disease or disability: The genes we inherit might see us born with cystic fibrosis or predisposed to develop breast cancer. Then, through life, we are exposed to countless illnesses, injuries, and circumstances that can negatively impact our health. This makes proactively maintaining our physical well-being a priority, and there is a growing awareness of the many good habits we can embrace to stay healthy and energized. Food is the essential fuel of body and brain, with a well-balanced diet critical to good health. A mix of enough protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats, collectively called macronutrients, will provide much of the energy a person needs to keep active, as well as the nutrients needed to grow and repair the body. Alongside this, food provides most of the many smaller dose vitamins and minerals that support specific functions, ranging from skin health to DNA synthesis. And while a good diet helps our bodies to fight off illness, unhealthy foods increase the risk of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease\u2014we really are what we eat. Fueled by food and water (losing just 2 percent of our water content can impair mental and physical functions) our bodies thrive on exercise. From digging the garden to running a marathon, exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to our tissues and helps our cardiovascular system work more efficiently. People who exercise regularly not only have greater muscle strength and endurance, but are also less likely to develop heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers: Exercise reduces the risk of early death by around 30 percent. Both diet and exercise are essential for shedding the excess weight that contributes to many serious health issues. Maintaining a healthy Body Mass Index (an estimate of body fat based on weight and height) is shown to improve active life expectancy\u2014living longer without disease or disability. Obesity has also been linked to lack of sleep. Sleep does more than refresh the brain, it affects almost every part of the body. When sleeping, our heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure change, which may be important for the cardiovascular system. We also release hormones that help repair cells\u2014it\u2019s believed that deep sleep helps us make ATP, the body\u2019s energy molecule. Good health habits include making good life choices, such as not smoking, moderating alcohol intake, and even driving carefully. Consciously following medical advice improves the chances of staying healthy, while committing to regular check-ups can catch conditions early to enable timely treatment. This is the essence of \u201clooking after yourself,\u201d and in developing these good health habits, technology is playing a valuable role. Smartphones, wearables, and digital platforms have the capacity to reach millions of people with the potential to promote better health habits everywhere. Apps that set exercise goals can encourage people to move more frequently and even build regular exercise into their routines. Similarly, apps can help us understand the nutritional value of the food we eat, flagging our calorific intake or helping diabetics manage their blood-sugar levels. Meanwhile, wearables can actively monitor our vital signs and digital reminders can prompt us to take medication correctly. Since the global pandemic, telemedicine has become an integral part of healthcare with virtual medical appointments accepted as the norm. Usually intended to augment rather than replace physical face-to-face meetings, these appointments are seen as an efficient way to increase access to healthcare, enabling patients to consult clinicians when, where, and how it suits them best. For example, Blua, which is digital health by Bupa, offers people a range of services across virtual consultations, health programs for body and mind, and remote healthcare in 10 markets around the world. In addition to video consultations, these can include vital sign monitoring, digital health check-ups, digital mental health programs, delivery of medicines and more.Further hi-tech developments to improve healthcare include nanotechnology, which is now widely used in medicine.

Learn about the time period that took place 23 to 2.6 million years ago. From afar, Earth looked much as it does today when the Neogene period began. But looks are deceiving. Mountains rose, and sea levels fell. The climate cooled and dried. Species were forced to adapt or die. Though close to where they are today, the continents began the Neogene by crashing into each other. India continued its slow-moving collision with Asia, which had already started the giant push-up of the Himalaya that continues today. Italy pushed into Europe, giving rise to the Alps. Spain butted France, and the Pyrenees rose. Faulting, stretching, thinning, and lifting created parts of the Rocky, Sierra Nevada, and Cascade Mountains in North America. The high mountains altered air circulation and weather patterns, contributing to the drier and cooler climate. The Arctic ice cap grew and thickened. Snow and ice fell on the high mountains, locking up water far from the oceans. Sea levels plummeted, exposing land bridges between Africa and Eurasia and between Eurasia and North America. Eventually, South America moved north and merged with North America, forming the Isthmus of Panama. The continental connections gave animals that had evolved in isolation access to new lands. Elephants and apes wandered from Africa to Eurasia. Rabbits, pigs, saber-toothed cats, and rhinos went to Africa. Elephants and rhinos continued across the Bering Strait to North America. Horses went the other way. Ground sloths migrated from South America to North America; raccoons scurried south. Even rodents may have hopped Pacific islands en route to Australia from Southeast Asia.

        "title": "What if aliens exist\u2014but they're just hiding from us? The Dark Forest theory, explained",
        "text": "The chilling theory depicted in the Netflix series \u20183 Body Problem\u2019 is just one explanation for our lack of encounters with extraterrestrial intelligence. The famed Fermi paradox has bewitched astronomers for more than half a century. To put it concisely: If the cosmos is nearly 14 billion years old, then where are all the interstellar societies? Why haven\u2019t they popped over to say hello? Myriad solutions to this conundrum have been proposed, but perhaps none more chilling than the Dark Forest theory. As the supposition holds, the reason we can\u2019t see these alien civilizations is because they\u2019re all in hiding. Unlike humanity\u2014whose radio transmissions have long echoed throughout our local galactic neighborhood\u2014these societies have all concluded that it\u2019s simply too dangerous to broadcast their location to potentially hostile neighbors. It's a sobering thought\u2014and one that\u2019s gaining attention now that it\u2019s being depicted in 3 Body Problem, a Netflix adaptation of author Cixin Liu\u2019s literary trilogy. But is it a plausible solution to the Fermi paradox? Of all the posited answers, experts say the Dark Forest hypothesis seems less likely to be correct. It\u2019s possible that several extraterrestrial intelligences, or ETIs, would conceal themselves. But it\u2019s improbable that all of them will come to the same fear-based conclusion and hide away. (In the hunt for alien life, this planet just became a top suspect.) \u201cWe don\u2019t even see that same behavior on cultures here on Earth,\u201d says Moiya McTier, an astrophysicist, author, and folklorist. Some ETIs might have members that all act in perfect unison. But others will have divergent, independently behaving groups\u2014some who trend more toward aggression or pacifism, curiosity, or reclusiveness. If one of them waves hello, then that Dark Forest will get a brightly lit campfire for us to see. Ages 7-12 But technically anything is possible considering we don\u2019t have any evidence for ETIs to begin with. Perhaps everyone really is hiding. Maybe there truly is a threat lurking out there, somewhere in the dark. And maybe humanity just hasn\u2019t realized it yet. The Fermi Paradox was casually raised by physicist Enrico Fermi during a lunchtime chat way back in 1950. It has many nuances, but at its heart is this central premise: Our solar system is just 4.6 billion years old, whereas the universe is 13.8 billion years old. That is plenty of time for life on other planets to develop into technologically advanced societies, those that could set forth across the sea of stars and create outposts or new societies on countless worlds. But we have yet to find any sign of these societies. So where is everybody? \u201cThere are so many possible overlapping solutions to the Fermi paradox,\u201d says McTier. Is space simply too vast for alien societies to have reached Earth yet? Do all of them destroy themselves before becoming interstellar? Are we the only technologically advanced society in our corner of the cosmos? Is the evolution of life vanishingly rare? (This man launched the quest to find alien intelligence. It changed astronomy.) \u201cAll the Fermi paradox tells you is that civilizations are rare. It doesn\u2019t tell you why they\u2019re rare,\u201d says Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist and astrobiologist at Birkbeck, University of London. \u201cOne of the solutions is: yeah, they\u2019re all out there, but they\u2019re all hiding. If they give themselves away, someone will come and destroy them.\u201d The idea that these spacefaring aliens are simply reluctant to reveal themselves has featured in sci-fi storytelling for many decades. Liu, in his 2008 book, gave the hypothesis a catchy name. He describes the universe as a dark forest, wherein each alien society is like a fearful, armed hunter gingerly moving forth. If that hunter finds \u201cother life\u2014another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod\u2014there\u2019s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people.\u201d Being fearful has its evolutionary benefits: We may flinch at a strange noise in the night, and although most of the time it\u2019s harmless, our caution may save our lives the one time it\u2019s coming from a genuine threat. \u201cIt can\u2019t be denied that there is some survival value in being aggressive,\u201d Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute in California. Preemptively take out the competition, and you may sleep more securely while getting extra resources. The history of humanity\u2014and its present\u2014is littered with grim examples of this. Thankfully, the Dark Forest has a plethora of issues that are difficult to resolve\u2014the most obvious being that it\u2019s extremely difficult to conceal a technologically advanced world. Long before actively searching for ETIs became a global scientific practice, radio signals from Earth\u2019s quotidian intraspecies communications have been emanating into the void\u2014something that a nearby alien society hoping to find a new ally, or fresh target, could handily spot. (How many alien civilizations are out there? A galactic survey holds a clue.) Even as we\u2019ve begun to grasp the hypothetical threat, it's not like we\u2019re about to go completely silent, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve never given the slightest thought to turning off all the radars because it might be dangerous,\u201d says Shostak. \u201cIt\u2019s just not gonna happen.\u201d Even if an ETI tried to conceal itself, it may not be sophisticated enough to work.

But the distances between them are likely to be unfathomably vast, so much so that the idea they would feel the need to preemptively attack one another seems odd.

Or, as Jebari has suggested in a recent paper, ETIs have reached the same logical conclusion: that they still exist because other advanced alien societies have chosen not to smite them, perhaps hoping instead to have a mutually beneficial conversation. \u201cWe have no reason to attack them in a preemptive strike,\u201d says Jebari. \u201cIf they\u2019re smart\u2026 maybe they\u2019re thinking the same thing about us.\u201d That all ETIs would share the very human instinct of assuming the worst about an unknown entity is also a massive presumption. \u201cFor me, [the Dark Forest] is one of the less compelling explanations for the Fermi paradox, because it relies on a few anthropocentric assumptions that I don\u2019t think are fair,\u201d says McTier.

        "onlytext": "The famed Fermi paradox has bewitched astronomers for more than half a century. To put it concisely: If the cosmos is nearly 14 billion years old, then where are all the interstellar societies? Why haven\u2019t they popped over to say hello? Myriad solutions to this conundrum have been proposed, but perhaps none more chilling than the Dark Forest theory. As the supposition holds, the reason we can\u2019t see these alien civilizations is because they\u2019re all in hiding. Unlike humanity\u2014whose radio transmissions have long echoed throughout our local galactic neighborhood\u2014these societies have all concluded that it\u2019s simply too dangerous to broadcast their location to potentially hostile neighbors.\n\nIt's a sobering thought\u2014and one that\u2019s gaining attention now that it\u2019s being depicted in 3 Body Problem, a Netflix adaptation of author Cixin Liu\u2019s literary trilogy. But is it a plausible solution to the Fermi paradox? Of all the posited answers, experts say the Dark Forest hypothesis seems less likely to be correct. It\u2019s possible that several extraterrestrial intelligences, or ETIs, would conceal themselves. But it\u2019s improbable that all of them will come to the same fear-based conclusion and hide away.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even see that same behavior on cultures here on Earth,\u201d says Moiya McTier, an astrophysicist, author, and folklorist. Some ETIs might have members that all act in perfect unison. But others will have divergent, independently behaving groups\u2014some who trend more toward aggression or pacifism, curiosity, or reclusiveness. If one of them waves hello, then that Dark Forest will get a brightly lit campfire for us to see.\n\nAges 7-12 But technically anything is possible considering we don\u2019t have any evidence for ETIs to begin with. Perhaps everyone really is hiding. Maybe there truly is a threat lurking out there, somewhere in the dark. And maybe humanity just hasn\u2019t realized it yet.\n\nThe Fermi Paradox was casually raised by physicist Enrico Fermi during a lunchtime chat way back in 1950. It has many nuances, but at its heart is this central premise: Our solar system is just 4.6 billion years old, whereas the universe is 13.8 billion years old. That is plenty of time for life on other planets to develop into technologically advanced societies, those that could set forth across the sea of stars and create outposts or new societies on countless worlds. But we have yet to find any sign of these societies. So where is everybody?\n\n\u201cThere are so many possible overlapping solutions to the Fermi paradox,\u201d says McTier. Is space simply too vast for alien societies to have reached Earth yet? Do all of them destroy themselves before becoming interstellar? Are we the only technologically advanced society in our corner of the cosmos? Is the evolution of life vanishingly rare?\n\n\u201cAll the Fermi paradox tells you is that civilizations are rare. It doesn\u2019t tell you why they\u2019re rare,\u201d says Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist and astrobiologist at Birkbeck, University of London. \u201cOne of the solutions is: yeah, they\u2019re all out there, but they\u2019re all hiding. If they give themselves away, someone will come and destroy them.\u201d\n\nThe idea that these spacefaring aliens are simply reluctant to reveal themselves has featured in sci-fi storytelling for many decades. Liu, in his 2008 book, gave the hypothesis a catchy name. He describes the universe as a dark forest, wherein each alien society is like a fearful, armed hunter gingerly moving forth. If that hunter finds \u201cother life\u2014another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod\u2014there\u2019s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people.\u201d\n\nBeing fearful has its evolutionary benefits: We may flinch at a strange noise in the night, and although most of the time it\u2019s harmless, our caution may save our lives the one time it\u2019s coming from a genuine threat. \u201cIt can\u2019t be denied that there is some survival value in being aggressive,\u201d Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute in California. Preemptively take out the competition, and you may sleep more securely while getting extra resources. The history of humanity\u2014and its present\u2014is littered with grim examples of this.\n\nThankfully, the Dark Forest has a plethora of issues that are difficult to resolve\u2014the most obvious being that it\u2019s extremely difficult to conceal a technologically advanced world. Long before actively searching for ETIs became a global scientific practice, radio signals from Earth\u2019s quotidian intraspecies communications have been emanating into the void\u2014something that a nearby alien society hoping to find a new ally, or fresh target, could handily spot.\n\nEven as we\u2019ve begun to grasp the hypothetical threat, it's not like we\u2019re about to go completely silent, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve never given the slightest thought to turning off all the radars because it might be dangerous,\u201d says Shostak. \u201cIt\u2019s just not gonna happen.\u201d Even if an ETI tried to conceal itself, it may not be sophisticated enough to work. Some alien societies may have found a way to stamp out all their noise, but others may be accidentally still giving the game away without realizing.\n\n\u201cThe way cavemen might hide is quite different from the way Klingons might hide,\u201d says Shostak.

        "text": "From microbes to four-legged critters, dead trees play an essential role in a forest\u2019s ecosystem. Experts say it's rare that removal is necessary. At first glance, a dead tree might seem to be little more than a barren, crumbling log. But look closer. Beneath the splintering bark, the wood is teeming with life. From burrowing beetles to wood-decay fungi to roosting bats, a whole community of critters has settled in, their very survival often dependent on the tree\u2019s demise.\u00a0 Dead trees are now becoming a focal point of forest management. Recent decades have brought greater understanding of the vital function dead trees serve in supporting biodiversity and forest regeneration\u2014and, with it, a growing movement to preserve them.\u00a0 \u201cLeave them there,\u201d says David Lindenmayer, forest ecologist and professor of ecology and conservation biology at the Australian National University. \u201cLarge dead trees have a very, very important role for storing carbon, providing habitat, [and] nutrient recycling.\u201d Despite their many benefits, dead trees can pose a safety risk in some circumstances. Experts explain their ecological function and how to make a decision about allowing them to decompose naturally.\u00a0 The death of a tree is hardly the end. Instead, a rapid transformation begins, bringing new vitality into the lifeless branches. Upon its death, the tree\u2019s tightly sealed plumbing, previously used to funnel nutrients and water, becomes empty and permeable, according to Matteo Garbelotto, a professor of forest pathology at the University of California, Berkeley.\u00a0 Ages 7-12 These hollowed out skeletons, still standing upright, are also known as snags or wildlife trees. Because of their verticality, snags can host a high diversity of species that varies from top to bottom. Fallen trees\u2014often called logs\u2014are also valuable habitats, though for a different group of smaller-scale species, Garbelotto says.\u00a0 Both are like magnets for all sorts of life, starting with fungi. \u201cWood-decay basidiomycetes are unusual in that they can break down a major compound of the wood called lignin,\u201d says Gregory Gilbert, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \u201cOnce that is broken down, the easier-to-eat cellulose is available for other fungi, insects, and bacteria.\u201d Fungi do much of the hard work of expediting the decomposition process, softening the hard trunk into something porous and penetrable. This allows in a whole host of colonizers seeking safe refuge and sustenance: beetles burrow in to lay eggs, amphibians and rodents nestle under detached bark, and insectivorous birds build nests within the trunk itself.\u00a0 The assemblage of wildlife changes over the course of the tree\u2019s decay, with each new species contributing to and profiting from its crumbling. Logs generally increase opportunities for insects, amphibians, and reptiles and are \u201ccomplementary\u201d to snags, Gilbert says. While some organisms like bark beetles and woodpeckers strongly prefer dead or rotting wood for nesting, others, including wood-decaying fungi, can only survive in deadwood.\u00a0 In the U.S., more than 1,200 wildlife species rely on dead or dying trees for shelter and food. The survival of these so-called \u201csaproxylic organisms,\u201d which live in decaying wood, is threatened by over-clearing of snags and logs, Lindenmayer says. \u201cIn the northern hemisphere, in places like Sweden, Norway, Finland\u2026you\u2019ve got very large numbers of red-listed species that are associated with deadwood,\u201d he adds. Violet click beetles and knothole moss, for instance, are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. And it\u2019s not just the animals who rely on decaying trees. They provide natural protection and sustenance for young seedlings to sprout safely, according to Lindenmayer. As trees decompose, carbon and nitrogen stores are slowly reabsorbed into the soil, a critical step in nutrient recycling, both for saplings and for the larger ecosystem.\u00a0 From a climate perspective, letting trees rot is critical, Lindenmayer says. Large trees in particular act as significant carbon sinks, and allowing them to decompose naturally extends the carbon sequestration process, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide\u2014and, thus, heat\u2014in the atmosphere. Whenever possible, forestry experts prefer to leave dead trees untouched. \u201cIn forested areas, we would typically recommend that standing trees be left that way,\u201d says Kevin Rohling, a specialist in forest management and ecology at the University of Illinois.\u00a0 This advice marks a change of tune from previous generations when uncontrolled logging and forest clearing were common practice. Today, within both public agencies and private consultants, \u201cthere is an emphasis on retaining deadwood and snags in forested areas,\u201d Rohling says. \u201cAs the amount of private forest that's used for logging has decreased in California, and as the Forest Service has implemented this wildlife tree policy, I think things definitely are looking up,\u201d Garbelotto says. Still, there are certain areas where leaving snags can be problematic. \u201cAnywhere there's the possibility of a dead tree harming people or property\u2014in those cases, oftentimes, we just recommend removal,\u201d Rohling says. In deciding whether or not to clear a tree, he says it\u2019s important to consider whether a tree might deteriorate or collapse completely and, if so, whether it could hit something, particularly in high-use areas like playgrounds, campgrounds, and roadways. When in doubt, he advises people to consult with a certified arborist or other tree care professional. Is there any benefit to keeping a dead tree in your backyard? Again, the answer depends on context, according to experts.\u00a0 \u201cFor personal properties, it\u2019s a little bit more complex,\u201d Garbelotto says. Trees infected by diseases like sudden oak death, for instance, can appear healthy despite growing progressively drier and structurally unsound. For people who live in wildfire-prone territory, such as the wildland urban interface, he adds, \u201ckeeping a dead tree within your property\u2014unless your property is very large\u2014really represents a big risk.\u201d Whether clearing dead trees reduces or increases wildfire susceptibility remains a topic of much debate. Lindenmayer, for his part, is adamant that protecting snags doesn\u2019t exacerbate the risk. It takes a lot to make deadwood catch on fire (other fuel is nearby, fire is hot enough, dry conditions and wind are present, etc.) compared to smaller debris like pine needles and twigs. That\u2019s why deadwood does not contribute as much to quick-fire spread, according to an article from Oregon State University. That said, deadwood can be harder to put out once it is ablaze. Still, the biodiversity boost from retaining dead trees is probably small in a private backyard environment. \u201cI think it would help,\u201d Garbelotto says. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re not getting the whole suite of benefits you\u2019re getting when you're doing this in the forest.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "After 30 years of decline, tuberculosis is rising in the U.S. again. How did we get here?",
        "text": "Since the pandemic\u2019s explosion in 2020, resource diversion to COVID tracking and treatment may have allowed TB to spread unchecked. After declining for three decades, tuberculosis (TB) rates in the U.S. have been increasing steadily since 2020, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s a disturbing trend given that 1.5 million die from TB every year, making it the world\u2019s most infectious killer. \"Even the people who don't die of the disease, they're hospitalized [and] have a lot of long-term problems from having TB,\u201d says Priya Shete, associate medical professor and co-director of the University of California, San Francisco Center for Tuberculosis. \u201cIf we allow continued increases in tuberculosis globally\u2026over time that's going to affect us as well.\" Nationwide, 2023 saw the highest number of cases reported in the last decade. Most of these recent cases are not instances of novel transmission, but sudden activation of latent infections that were undetected or improperly treated. While TB impacts thousands nationally and millions around the world, \"most people in the U.S. are not at risk of developing TB,\u201d says Philip LoBue, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination.\u00a0 Compared with high TB incidence countries like India, China, and the Philippines, the chance of infection in the U.S. is still one of the lowest in the world. But the recent trend reversal has raised questions\u2014and some alarm bells\u2014among infectious disease and public health experts. Here they offer insight into the causes and implications of the sudden upswing in cases. Tuberculosis is one of the oldest and deadliest diseases in human history. For millennia, the infection has afflicted people around the globe, earning ominous nicknames like \u201cthe white plague,\u201d \u201cconsumption,\u201d and even \u201cthe robber of youth.\u201d A century and a half ago, TB was essentially a death sentence\u2014roughly\u00a080 percent of active infections were fatal. Since then, rates have been on the decline in the U.S. and abroad, thanks to new vaccines, diagnostics, and antibiotic treatments. Ages 7-12 The disease is caused by a highly contagious bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also\u00a0damage the kidneys, heart, bones, joints, and blood vessels. If it spreads, it can cause meningitis, swelling of the brain and spinal cord, or hepatitis, inflammation of the liver. TB transmits through prolonged exposure to infectious airborne particles, such as from coughing or sneezing. A person infected with TB often does not display symptoms or know they\u2019re sick for weeks or even years\u2014called a \u201clatent\u201d infection. But the infection may become active, and contagious, at any time.\u00a0 Even if the bacteria is detected and an effective antibiotic is prescribed, the treatment regimen is long\u2014several months\u2014which makes patient compliance difficult.\u00a0 \u201cWe need constant surveillance and suppression to keep TB in a latent form,\u201d says Jeffrey Cox, professor of immunology and pathogenesis at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIf you remove that pressure, the bacteria can then start growing again.\u201d While both preventable and curable, TB remains a leading infectious killer worldwide, claiming over a million lives every year. The disease affects millions in every country and age group, but hits particularly hard in low- and middle-income populations. From a public health perspective, it\u2019s no surprise that tuberculosis counts have been on the rise since 2020. When the pandemic hit, reporting of other communicable diseases like TB initially plummeted as the majority of resources went towards COVID.\u00a0 \u201cMost countries actually had a dip [in cases] from 2019 to 2020,\u201d Cox says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that TB went down.\u201d In fact, the pandemic-era emphasis on coronavirus tracing and treatment may have allowed TB infections to multiply unchecked.\u00a0 \u201cA lot of those lower priority activities of health care\u2014maintenance and prevention\u2014were deferred,\u201d says Shete. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing a great job prioritizing TB prevention.\u201d Cox describes a sort of snowball effect: If people don\u2019t get tested or report infections, they don\u2019t get the treatment they need and can transmit the infection to others. Waning mask-wearing and increased travel can also exacerbate the spread. Compared with previous caseloads, new TB patients are \u201coften more sick at the time that they\u2019re diagnosed,\u201d Shete says. During the pandemic, some physicians may have misidentified or failed to take their symptoms seriously. \u201cIt can be kind of the slow burn of a disease where people start to lose weight, they start to feel crummy, they have a chronic cough, and maybe not seek care as quickly.\u201d LoBue agrees, citing \u201cthe similarity of pulmonary TB disease and COVID-19 symptoms\u201d and disrupted health care access during the pandemic as key factors in the initial drop, then rise, in cases.\u00a0 As before the pandemic, most recent cases\u2014a whopping 80 percent\u2014occur when untreated, latent infections become active. This most often happens to people whose immune systems are weakened, particularly from diseases like HIV or certain immune-suppressing medications, according to LoBue. In contrast, a healthy immune system could keep the infection at bay indefinitely. Within the U.S., those most susceptible to TB continue to be people born in, or frequent visitors to, countries where TB is common, working or living in riskier settings like schools and high-density housing, or those with weaker immune systems, according to Shete. \u201cTuberculosis, just generally speaking, is often called a \u2018disease of poverty,\u2019\u201d she says. People experiencing food insecurity, poor access to basic health services, and inadequate or crowded living conditions are at higher risk of infection and often lack the resources for testing or treatment. Of people born in the U.S., TB rates are highest among those \u201cwho have historically been minoritized or marginalized, socioeconomically or racially or ethnically,\u201d Shete says, including Black and Latinx populations. According to the latest CDC report, Black Americans represented the largest number\u201433 percent\u2014of U.S.-born TB cases, followed by Hispanic and white Americans.\u00a0 Still, Cox emphasizes that national numbers \u201cpale in comparison\u201d with the rest of the world. And whether the increased cases are just a \u201cblip\u201d or continue to trend upwards remains to be seen. \u201cUntil we have more years of data, we can't say for sure,\u201d agrees the CDC\u2019s LoBue. Experts urge people to stay informed about TB, without raising unnecessary alarm. Shete says it\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s fully preventable, diagnosable, and treatable. Those outside of high-risk groups generally don\u2019t have to worry unless they notice symptoms or are exposed to someone with an active infection. That said, Shete adds, \u201cI hesitate to make it less important to most people only because it just takes one person in your community to have TB.\u201d The greater burden falls on healthcare professionals and the public health system. Particularly among high-risk populations, Shete says that physicians should regularly screen for TB. These preventative measures should be included in Medicare coverage, which is not always the case. Just last year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a recommendation for screening asymptomatic adults at increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection for the first time since 2016. Long-term management of TB cases will require ongoing investment in clinical research and the development of more effective diagnostics and antibiotics, Cox says. \u201cIt does take that kind of infrastructure and constant surveillance and funds from the government to keep those programs going,\u201d Cox says.\u00a0 Ultimately, the risk of TB for U.S. residents is mercifully low. But effective mitigation of the infection at home relies on attacking it on a global scale. The U.S. has made this a priority, through international programs like USAID\u2019s Global TB Strategy and the CDC\u2019s Division of Global HIV & TB, which is working to combat the two epidemics simultaneously.\u00a0 As Shete says, \u201cWhatever is happening in the world is going to affect us too in the U.S.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "onlytext": "After declining for three decades, tuberculosis (TB) rates in the U.S. have been increasing steadily since 2020, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s a disturbing trend given that 1.5 million die from TB every year, making it the world\u2019s most infectious killer. \"Even the people who don't die of the disease, they're hospitalized [and] have a lot of long-term problems from having TB,\u201d says Priya Shete, associate medical professor and co-director of the University of California, San Francisco Center for Tuberculosis. \u201cIf we allow continued increases in tuberculosis globally\u2026over time that's going to affect us as well.\" Nationwide, 2023 saw the highest number of cases reported in the last decade. Most of these recent cases are not instances of novel transmission, but sudden activation of latent infections that were undetected or improperly treated. While TB impacts thousands nationally and millions around the world, \"most people in the U.S. are not at risk of developing TB,\u201d says Philip LoBue, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination.  Compared with high TB incidence countries like India, China, and the Philippines, the chance of infection in the U.S. is still one of the lowest in the world. But the recent trend reversal has raised questions\u2014and some alarm bells\u2014among infectious disease and public health experts. \n\nTuberculosis is one of the oldest and deadliest diseases in human history. For millennia, the infection has afflicted people around the globe, earning ominous nicknames like \u201cthe white plague,\u201d \u201cconsumption,\u201d and even \u201cthe robber of youth.\u201d A century and a half ago, TB was essentially a death sentence\u2014roughly  80 percent of active infections were fatal. Since then, rates have been on the decline in the U.S. and abroad, thanks to new vaccines, diagnostics, and antibiotic treatments. \n\nThe disease is caused by a highly contagious bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also  damage the kidneys, heart, bones, joints, and blood vessels. If it spreads, it can cause meningitis, swelling of the brain and spinal cord, or hepatitis, inflammation of the liver. TB transmits through prolonged exposure to infectious airborne particles, such as from coughing or sneezing. A person infected with TB often does not display symptoms or know they\u2019re sick for weeks or even years\u2014called a \u201clatent\u201d infection. But the infection may become active, and contagious, at any time.  Even if the bacteria is detected and an effective antibiotic is prescribed, the treatment regimen is long\u2014several months\u2014which makes patient compliance difficult.  \u201cWe need constant surveillance and suppression to keep TB in a latent form,\u201d says Jeffrey Cox, professor of immunology and pathogenesis at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIf you remove that pressure, the bacteria can then start growing again.\u201d \n\nWhile both preventable and curable, TB remains a leading infectious killer worldwide, claiming over a million lives every year. The disease affects millions in every country and age group, but hits particularly hard in low- and middle-income populations. From a public health perspective, it\u2019s no surprise that tuberculosis counts have been on the rise since 2020.

        "title": "Should you be concerned about your microwave?",
        "text": "Though there are isolated and rare cases of radiation injury from microwave use, experts say they emit less electromagnetic radiation than candles. Microwave ovens have long been a staple in kitchens worldwide, revolutionizing the way people cook and consume food. However, a small but growing movement is going microwave-free, driven by health risks and food quality concerns.\u00a0 Conversations on social media platforms reveal a sentiment that microwaves are unsafe. Individuals, confident in the health benefits of going microwave-free, share their personal experiences in testimonials often accompanied by sentiments like \u201cI\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d Some claim that microwave cooking depletes food of nutrients and harms health.\u00a0 But are these concerns legitimate?\u00a0 Microwave ovens rely on a unique form of non-ionizing radiation, known as \u201cmicrowaves,\u201d that are distinct from the ionizing radiation found in x-rays and other high-energy sources. According to Christopher Baird, a physicist at West Texas A&M University who specializes in electromagnetics, the microwaves in our kitchens are a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radio waves. (Could a pill protect us from radiation after a nuclear meltdown?) \u201cIt\u2019s exceedingly rare for a microwave oven to malfunction badly enough to harm a nearby human,\u201d Baird says. \u201cEven in those exceedingly rare cases, no damage is done beyond burns and surface nerve damage.\u201d Microwave ovens are a staple in American kitchens, but that wasn't always the case. Microwave ovens were initially conceived by Percy Spencer in 1945 after he observed heat-generating microwaves emitted by a magnetron during a radar experiment. His first attempt at converting this to a kitchen tool was colossal, towering at around six feet and weighing over 750 pounds\u2014a far cry from modern models. When wartime technology was adapted for domestic use following WWII, it resulted in smaller, more user-friendly microwave ovens in American kitchens. Subsequently, the \u201870s saw a notable shift in American eating habits. Food companies increasingly catered to busy families and individuals or those who preferred not to cook, expanding their offerings to frozen, microwavable dinners and snacks\u2014a trend that increased Americans' dependence on prepared, convenient foods.\u00a0 Today, ready-to-enjoy dinners from lasagna to chicken pot pie provide budget-friendly, single-serve meals in a matter of minutes\u2014the frozen foods market witnessed $72.2 billion in sales in 2022, with frozen meals alone accounting for $25.8 billion.\u00a0 (Learn more about how ultra-processed food harms our bodies and brains.) Microwave ovens inhabit 96 percent of American households, according to an Energy Information Administration Residential Energy Consumption Survey, with 99 percent of those households using the appliance at least once every week. Fast-paced lifestyles beckoning convenient solutions such as microwavable foods drives market growth in an industry set to surpass 230 million by 2031, according to market research.\u00a0 While the microwave itself doesn\u2019t present a health risk, ultra-processed foods like ready-to-eat frozen dinners have known health issues.\u00a0 Microwaves exist on a low- to high-frequency spectrum, according to NASA, and make modern technology like radio, text messaging, x-rays, and GPS possible.\u00a0 The heart of a microwave oven lies in its magnetron tube, which generates these microwaves. Once produced, they bounce off the oven's metallic interior, creating a highly controlled cooking environment. When microwaves encounter water molecules, they induce rapid vibration within these molecules, generating friction as they jostle against one another. This friction, in turn, creates heat, or thermal energy, effectively warming up the food.\u00a0 Microwaves primarily cook food from the outside in. Foods with a higher water content, such as fresh vegetables, tend to cook more quickly because microwave radiation easily heats water.\u00a0 (Do you wash your meat? Experts say it actually spreads germs.) Ionizing radiation alters atoms and molecules and damages cells in organic matter, whereas non-ionizing radiation merely causes heating via thermal energy. Because non-ionizing radiation emits less energy than even visible light and doesn\u2019t alter the atoms and molecules inside our body, it can safely be used inside the home, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIf the microwave radiation used in microwave ovens somehow toxified the food it cooked, then the radio waves continuously being emitted by the household Wi-Fi router would be toxifying all of the food in the house in the same way,\u201d says Baird. He emphasizes that neither of these concerns are valid. Even candlelight has more electromagnetic waves than microwave ovens. Logically, \u201cpeople would need to be more worried about candlelight\u201d if such claims about microwaves were accurate, says Baird. The FDA acknowledges the existence of isolated and rare cases of radiation injury linked to microwave oven use, mainly due to issues like a broken microwave seal.\u00a0 \u201cHigh-energy electromagnetic waves can induce significant electric currents in nerves, potentially causing burns and damage,\u201d says Baird. He cites rare instances where malfunctioning microwave ovens have caused nerve damage in individuals reaching into or near the oven.\u00a0 The FDA says there is little reason for concern unless the microwave oven sustains damage that could allow microwaves to escape.\u00a0 For safety reasons, the FDA advises against using certain plastic containers, metal pans, and aluminum foil in the microwave. Mounting evidence suggests that microwaving plastic, even those labeled \u2018microwave safe,\u2019 leeches harmful microscopic plastic particles into food. \u00a0 Microwave heated foods retain moisture on the surface, preventing a desirable appearance, such as a golden-brown crust, from developing on certain foods. Nonetheless, the findings of a study published in 2020 emphasize the advantages of short processing times, low heating temperatures, and relatively low power levels, all of which prevent nutrients from being lost.\u00a0 Some research favors microwaving and baking over pressure cooking and boiling methods for preserving vegetable antioxidants. Vitamins A and C, for example, hold up particularly well in microwaved foods. And microwaving raw trout causes quantities of vitamin K to increase.\u00a0 One paper published in the journal Food Science and Nutrition even found microwave ovens use less energy and water than other common cooking tools. The International Microwave Power Institute also dispels a common rumor\u2014that countries such as Japan and Russia banned microwave ovens due to radiation. There is no evidence supporting these claims, which went viral on social media within the last few years amid the rising interest in the microwave-free lifestyle movement\u2014which continues unabated.

        "title": "Does the perfect workout really exist?",
        "text": "From trampolines to rebound boots, playful approaches to fitness abound. But some doubt their health benefits, so we asked the experts. The first time Olympia Cure tried a pair of rebound boots\u2014a ski-boot-like shoe with a flexible, plastic oval attached to the bottom\u2014she \u201cfelt like a kid on a trampoline.\u201d Soon after, Cure, a fitness enthusiast and part-time roller skating instructor in Chicago, launched Chainless Movements, a group rebound class that resembles step aerobics on space-age stilts. Since December, she says, she\u2019s lost five pounds, and her endurance has increased. A 2019 ClassPass survey found that participation in non-traditional fitness classes, such as trampoline workouts, bungee fitness, and dance cardio, increased by 82 percent compared to the previous year. But to some, classes like Cure\u2019s\u2014plus a swath of other trendy group workouts like bungee fitness, trampoline jumping, and drumstick routines\u2014have become the subject of ridicule. On sites like YouTube and TikTok, millions have posted videos with the running joke, Middle Aged Women Doing Anything But Working Out.\u00a0 Traditionalists sometimes view unconventional workouts as fads lacking scientific backing, while proponents argue that these new methods can enhance motivation and make exercise more accessible and enjoyable.\u00a0 Yet, with a glut of information and limited time, choosing the best way to work out can be daunting. Research alone suggests one should forego the flying bungees. But what about exercisers disinclined to hit a weight bench or intimidated by CrossFit? Is there any such thing as a perfect workout? Here\u2019s what the experts say. Though there are few large, high-quality studies on trampolining and other fitness trends, the studies that do exist suggest it improves balance, cardiovascular fitness, and pelvic floor musculature. It is also gentler on the joints and often has a lower perceived level of exertion since it is generally more fun.\u00a0 However, the value of weightlifting and high-intensity cardio for weight loss has been around for years. A recent study found that lifting reduced women\u2019s cardiovascular mortality by a whopping 30 percent.\u00a0 (Lifting heavy weights is for middle-aged women too.) But Mike Roussell, author of Strength: The Field Manual and a nutrition expert, says it\u2019s more about ticking certain fitness boxes than one particular workout. \u201cYou need cardiovascular training, and you need resistance training, and having both is the ultimate fitness r\u00e9sum\u00e8,\u201d he says. In the cardio \u201cbucket,\u201d Roussell says, aim for low-intensity cardio\u2014low enough to hold a conversation while you move\u2014and bursts of high intensity. Low-intensity cardio strengthens parts of the heart, lowering blood pressure and resting heart rate. In high-intensity cardio, the heart pumps more intensively and forces the body to use different kinds of fuel, called metabolic flexibility, which boosts longevity and disease prevention.\u00a0 Then there\u2019s the resistance \u201cbucket.\u201d Building strength and power contribute to longevity, says Roussell, partly because lean body mass helps prevent falls and fractures later in life and makes it easier to maintain muscle later. \u201cIt\u2019s just like your retirement savings,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend it, but at least you have it there.\u201d\u00a0 (Here\u2019s what lifting weights does to your body\u2014and your mind.) As if that weren\u2019t enough to make the barbell-averse reconsider, resistance training has also contributed to brain health. \u201cIt\u2019s like physical Sudoku,\u201d says Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist with expertise in women\u2019s athletics.\u00a0\u201cWordle and Sudoku are good for neural pathways. But you could do resistance training and get a bigger bang for your buck because you get better muscles, better metabolic control, and brain health.\u201d Sims recommends thinking of resistance training in terms of three movement planes: quad-dominant/glute-dominant (think squats), push-pull upper body (bench overhead press), and posterior work (deadlifts and Cossack squats).\u00a0 \u201cThen you\u2019re looking at the functionality of the different planes of movement and the different exercises that you can put in there, depending on what people are doing in their lives,\u201d she adds. This isn\u2019t the first time a trendy workout has faced criticism. In the early 20th century, calisthenics and gymnastics were sometimes considered too basic and rigid, unsuitable for all populations. The 1950s and 1960s brought home workouts into the spotlight, but programs like Jack LaLanne\u2019s were criticized for their simplistic approach and lack of personalized guidance, potentially leading to injuries.\u00a0 The aerobics boom of the 1970s and 1980s, popularized by Jane Fonda, faced criticism for its high-impact nature, which could cause joint injuries. At the same time, bodybuilding was scrutinized for promoting unrealistic body images and the use of steroids. (The exercise phenomenon born in a prisoner-of-war camp.) In the 1990s, step aerobics and spinning were noted for the risk of repetitive strain injuries, and yoga and Pilates were sometimes dismissed as too gentle or ineffective for weight loss. The 2000s saw the rise of functional fitness with CrossFit, which faced criticism for high injury rates and intense workouts, as did boot camps and HIIT for being potentially dangerous for beginners. From the 2010s to the present, boutique fitness studios have sometimes been seen as elitist due to their high costs, while digital and at-home workouts raised concerns about a lack of personalized guidance.\u00a0 For both Sims and Rousell, the best workouts are those that take real life into account.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nBut some doubt their health benefits, so we asked the experts. The first time Olympia Cure tried a pair of rebound boots\u2014a ski-boot-like shoe with a flexible, plastic oval attached to the bottom\u2014she \u201cfelt like a kid on a trampoline.\u201d Soon after, Cure, a fitness enthusiast and part-time roller skating instructor in Chicago, launched Chainless Movements, a group rebound class that resembles step aerobics on space-age stilts. Since December, she says, she\u2019s lost five pounds, and her endurance has increased. A 2019 ClassPass survey found that participation in non-traditional fitness classes, such as trampoline workouts, bungee fitness, and dance cardio, increased by 82 percent compared to the previous year. But to some, classes like Cure\u2019s\u2014plus a swath of other trendy group workouts like bungee fitness, trampoline jumping, and drumstick routines\u2014have become the subject of ridicule. On sites like YouTube and TikTok, millions have posted videos with the running joke, Middle Aged Women Doing Anything But Working Out. \n\nTraditionalists sometimes view unconventional workouts as fads lacking scientific backing, while proponents argue that these new methods can enhance motivation and make exercise more accessible and enjoyable.  Yet, with a glut of information and limited time, choosing the best way to work out can be daunting. Research alone suggests one should forego the flying bungees. But what about exercisers disinclined to hit a weight bench or intimidated by CrossFit? Is there any such thing as a perfect workout? Here\u2019s what the experts say. Though there are few large, high-quality studies on trampolining and other fitness trends, the studies that do exist suggest it improves balance, cardiovascular fitness, and pelvic floor musculature. It is also gentler on the joints and often has a lower perceived level of exertion since it is generally more fun. \n\nHowever, the value of weightlifting and high-intensity cardio for weight loss has been around for years. A recent study found that lifting reduced women\u2019s cardiovascular mortality by a whopping 30 percent.  (Lifting heavy weights is for middle-aged women too.) But Mike Roussell, author of Strength: The Field Manual and a nutrition expert, says it\u2019s more about ticking certain fitness boxes than one particular workout. \u201cYou need cardiovascular training, and you need resistance training, and having both is the ultimate fitness r\u00e9sum\u00e8,\u201d he says. In the cardio \u201cbucket,\u201d Roussell says, aim for low-intensity cardio\u2014low enough to hold a conversation while you move\u2014and bursts of high intensity. Low-intensity cardio strengthens parts of the heart, lowering blood pressure and resting heart rate. In high-intensity cardio, the heart pumps more intensively and forces the body to use different kinds of fuel, called metabolic flexibility, which boosts longevity and disease prevention. \n\nThen there\u2019s the resistance \u201cbucket.\u201d Building strength and power contribute to longevity, says Roussell, partly because lean body mass helps prevent falls and fractures later in life and makes it easier to maintain muscle later. \u201cIt\u2019s just like your retirement savings,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend it, but at least you have it there.\u201d  (Here\u2019s what lifting weights does to your body\u2014and your mind.) As if that weren\u2019t enough to make the barbell-averse reconsider, resistance training has also contributed to brain health. \u201cIt\u2019s like physical Sudoku,\u201d says Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist with expertise in women\u2019s athletics. \u201cWordle and Sudoku are good for neural pathways. But you could do resistance training and get a bigger bang for your buck because you get better muscles, better metabolic control, and brain health.\u201d Sims recommends thinking of resistance training in terms of three movement planes: quad-dominant/glute-dominant (think squats), push-pull upper body (bench overhead press), and posterior work (deadlifts and Cossack squats). \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time a trendy workout has faced criticism. In the early 20th century, calisthenics and gymnastics were sometimes considered too basic and rigid, unsuitable for all populations. The 1950s and 1960s brought home workouts into the spotlight, but programs like Jack LaLanne\u2019s were criticized for their simplistic approach and lack of personalized guidance, potentially leading to injuries.  The aerobics boom of the 1970s and 1980s, popularized by Jane Fonda, faced criticism for its high-impact nature, which could cause joint injuries. At the same time, bodybuilding was scrutinized for promoting unrealistic body images and the use of steroids. (The exercise phenomenon born in a prisoner-of-war camp.) In the 1990s, step aerobics and spinning were noted for the risk of repetitive strain injuries, and yoga and Pilates were sometimes dismissed as too gentle or ineffective for weight loss. The 2000s saw the rise of functional fitness with CrossFit, which faced criticism for high injury rates and intense workouts, as did boot camps and HIIT for being potentially dangerous for beginners. From the 2010s to the present, boutique fitness studios have sometimes been seen as elitist due to their high costs, while digital and at-home workouts raised concerns about a lack of personalized guidance. \n\nFor both Sims and Rousell, the best workouts are those that take real life into account. Roussell calls it \u201cthe gray area\u201d\u2014where fitness and nutrition goals meet things like business travel, parenting, and parties.  Instead, he says, the secret to success is embracing the nuances and realities of one\u2019s real-life demands. Start with what you enjoy, and add whatever exercise components you might be missing.

        "title": "Can a spoonful of honey keep seasonal allergies at bay?",
        "text": "Though research suggests home allergy remedies hardly ever work, some scientists want to know if honey might have a place in modern medicine. More people are searching for natural remedies to seasonal allergies, such as honey, to try and alleviate those pesky coughs, sneezes, and sniffles. But why are allergy sufferers flocking toward this natural sweetener? A nutrient-rich substance made to nourish bee colonies, humans have been harvesting honey for millennia. Many ancient cultures assigned myth and magic\u00a0to the sugary treat\u2019s wound-healing properties, and today, the syrup is a well-known balm against a sore throat. There are many other reasons why people champion honey as a solution to their physical issues\u2014for one, many assume that since it originates from local flora, it can strengthen the immune system against allergies.\u00a0 Yet the actual role honey plays in bolstering the body\u2019s natural defenses against allergies and other immune illnesses is still relatively unclear.\u00a0 \u201cThere's not really great evidence to suggest that local honey can help seasonal allergies,\u201d says Priya Katari, a pediatric allergist and immunologist at Weill Cornell Medicine. \u201cWhat evidence exists now really doesn't back up the claims.\u201d Still, honey has other, proven health benefits\u2014if you\u2019re getting the right kind of honey. Here\u2019s what to know. The idea that honey can be used to ward off seasonal ailments probably comes from the concept behind immunotherapy, which involves introducing very small amounts of an allergen over a prolonged period to aid an individual\u2019s immune system in tolerating it.\u00a0 Ages 7-12 In theory, consuming honey to relieve allergies seems like a plausible one. Unfortunately, pollen that typically causes seasonal allergies are wind-based, meaning it comes from trees, grass, or wheat, whereas bee\u2019s honey is made from pollen gathered from brightly-colored flowers\u2014which doesn\u2019t contribute much to allergens in the air. Because of this distinction, it\u2019s unlikely that pollens found in local honey would lead to tolerance, says Katari. Much of the current scientific consensus is that there hasn\u2019t yet been enough research done to definitively make the claim that honey can combat allergic reactions. There also isn\u2019t a scientifically recommended amount to eat per day either, as the quantity of pollen in one serving size of honey often varies as well. This means even if the honey did work, mass-produced bottles may not even reflect the sorts of allergens in your local environment.\u00a0 That said, individuals may have better luck wrangling their allergies by seeking over-the-counter or doctor-approved medicines. \u00a0 \u201cPeople really want a natural remedy for things, but I wish more people knew that the medications that we prescribe for allergies are generally very safe, including for children, and well-tolerated,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes natural remedies can be more dangerous and less effective than the treatments we prescribe.\u201d Babies less than a year old, for instance, shouldn\u2019t be given honey, as it could contain bacteria called Clostridium that \u00a0is associated with infant botulism. which can cause muscle weakness and trouble breathing. Other natural supplements like ginkgo and turmeric can increase the risk of \u00a0bleeding, says Katari. Although you shouldn\u2019t rely on honey alone to ease your allergies, there is growing interest in its potential applications in modern medicine.\u00a0 Ferhat Ozturk, an associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at San Antonio whose research involves studying the medicinal benefits of honey, says that it is not just a food, but a nutritious pharmaceutical agent.\u00a0 \u201cHoney was medicine for thousands of years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with the advent of antibiotics and other modern medicine, honey has been put aside for a couple of decades.\u201d\u00a0 Used topically, honey can treat burns by hastening wound contractions, and has reportedly been used as a complementary mouth sore aid for cancer patients going through chemotherapy.\u00a0 When ingested, the substance has been shown to have important properties for tempering gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, and colitis. Because of these therapeutic uses, researchers also plan to test potential uses of other bee byproducts (like royal jelly, propolis, beeswax) in various clinical trials.\u00a0 Most of these healing effects stem directly from honey\u2019s antimicrobial and antioxidant potential, says Ozturk. When honey bees collect nectar from plants, they also pick up chemicals the plants produce to protect themselves from pathogens, natural compounds like phenolics, flavonoids and tannins which can have anti-aging, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory effects on the human body. \u201cHoney is helping our body to fight naturally with its own power,\u201d says Ozturk. These same curative chemicals are why plants tend to cut down certain incidents of chronic illness, including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.\u00a0 That said, not every honey on the market is created equal. \u201cThere's at least five times more antimicrobial potential in local beekeeper honey when compared to store honey,\u201d he says.\u00a0 One honey in particular\u2014Manuka honey from New Zealand\u2014is considered to be one of the best antimicrobial honey agents, says Scott McArt, an associate professor of entomology at Cornell University. This is due in part to the product\u2019s uniquely high levels of alkaloids, specifically one called methylglyoxal (MGO), a major antibacterial compound that makes it a top medical-grade substance.\u00a0 Although many individuals consume this expensive honey for its health benefits, \u201cThe scientific evidence that consuming high-MGO Manuka honey provides health benefits to humans is currently not quite as strong as its clear benefits for wound treatment,\u201d says McArt.\u00a0 Given the amount of people who swear by honey as a complete panacea, it\u2019s doubtful that rumors about its potential health applications will ever subside.\u00a0 But if you do plan to hunker down with a delicious jar of honey during your next sick day, Ozturk suggests sourcing honey collected by local beekeepers, both for the potential health benefits and to learn more about what nature's hardest workers have to offer.\u00a0 \u201cHoney is something out there that has provided [a] benefit for almost every civilization on earth for thousands of years,\u201d Ozturk says. \u201cSo there is a lot to study about honey.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "text": "Good health isn\u2019t always visible or tangible: Bupa Picture of Health explores what \u201chealth\u201d means to six inspirational athletes. For any athlete, the moment the starting gun fires represents the moment when all their efforts of weeks, months, and years of training come together with critical focus. It is when every athlete needs to be at their peak physical and mental fitness\u2014with their unique and individual definitions of health underpinning their performance and success. To support Picture of Health, six Bupa athlete ambassadors share their inspirational stories and explore what \u201chealth\u201d means to them. \u201cMy Picture of Health is independence. Being happy, being fit, and being able to do the things I want to do,\u201d says Australian Para canoeist and former soldier, Curtis McGrath. A mine blast in Afghanistan took both of Curtis\u2019s legs, changing his life forever. \u201cOn the stretcher,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll see you guys in the Paralympic Games\u2019; and it wasn\u2019t a promise, it was more a statement of hope.\u201d Less than two years later, Curtis broke a world record and won the 200-meter VL2 world title in Moscow. He has since taken home 14 gold medals and one silver, including consecutive golds at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. \u201cIt's amazing to be in Paris,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just another line in my story of how far I\u2019ve come since lying on the ground in Afghanistan. Now I\u2019m here and it's exciting.\u201d \u201cFor me to be healthy, I need to be in a mental and physical state which allows me to develop and grow as a person. My Picture of Health is self belief,\u201d explains Chilean archer Mariana Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \u201cThis means I can be at my best in both life and my sport.\u201d Mariana was born with myelomeningocele, a form of spina bifida. \u201cI first began archery when I was 10 years old after watching the movie Brave,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd today I\u2019m on a beautiful journey in sport.\u201d When she won a silver medal, her achievement was celebrated across the continent as the first archer from the Americas to win in her category. \u201cFor me, being brave means facing obstacles,\u201d she says. \u201cFeeling all of the fear and emotions, but at the same time facing the challenges that life throws at me.\u201d \u201cMy Picture of Health is the strength to overcome difficulties that seemed impossible at first,\u201d says Polish shot put and club throw athlete, R\u00f3\u017ca Kozakowska. \u201cIn my case, impossible doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d R\u00f3\u017ca\u2019s nervous system was attacked after a tick bite and she developed articular and cerebral neuroborreliosis, a condition which impacts her coordination. \u201cI woke up one morning and just felt I was paralyzed,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I never gave up, I believed in myself, and this is how my adventure in sports for disabled people began.\u201d R\u00f3\u017ca not only won a gold medal in Tokyo 2020, but she also set a new world record and was named Poland\u2019s 2021 Disabled Athlete of the Year. \u201cDeveloping my physical fitness takes time, it is a hard, thorough process,\u201d she emphasizes. But it\u2019s worth it. \u201cWithout health, life is gray, boring, devoid of all color. It is the most important thing.\u201d \u201cMy Picture of Health is determination,\u201d declares Richard Whitehead, MBE, and British runner. From an early age, Richard learned to live life without limits, becoming the first double amputee to run the length of Great Britain\u201440 marathons in 40 days for charity. Since winning two Paralympic gold medals for the 200 meters, Richard has devoted his energy to using the power of sport for the benefit of disabled people. \u201cProbably my greatest achievement was accepting my disability as not a negative, but as a positive,\u201d he says. \u201cAn opportunity to show people that anything is possible; to represent a community that maybe didn\u2019t have representation when I was growing up.\u201d \u201cMy Picture of Health is energy,\u201d says British Para athlete Emmanuel Oyinbo-Coker. \u201cI say energy because it\u2019s quite similar to health in terms of how contagious it is. If someone is in good health, they would tend to promote good health habits,\u201d he explains. Missing his lower left arm, Emmanuel\u2019s running skill was spotted by a teacher. \u201cI came second out of all the schools in my council,\u201d he recalls, and he was encouraged to take running seriously by following a Para athlete pathway. \u201cI\u2019m representing Great Britain; I\u2019ve won a Commonwealth gold medal. And yeah, the Paralympic medal is the next one to come,\u201d he smiles. \u201cSleeping good, eating good, exercising, drinking lots of water, if you have good energy, you\u2019re feeling buzzy, you\u2019re feeling happy,\u201d he says. \u201cThat ability to influence others through how you\u2019re feeling is very helpful.\u201d \u201cMy picture of health is tranquility,\u201d explains Sara Andr\u00e9s Barrio, Spanish sprinter and long jumper. \u201cBecause when your health is good, you\u2019re whole, in peace, at ease with yourself.\u201d Sara lost her feet in an accident, but she seized what she saw as a second chance and took up sport to become more agile. \u201cI realized I loved athletics. It became my passion, and now my profession.\u201d A finalist in Rio, and having won double bronze and silver medals at the World Para Athletics Championships, Sara has a clear focus on health. \u201cI think having good health is the main thing, right?\u201d she asks. \u201cTo be able to enjoy life, to be fully calm knowing that everything is fine in your body and mind, to be able to enjoy the things that really matter, right?\u201d These extraordinary athletes have been photographed by world-renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz as part of Bupa's Picture of Health campaign. This aims to start a conversation about what health is, and what it can be\u2014using this series of dynamic and striking photos to inspire people to share their own pictures of health. From strength and independence to family and self-belief, these photos are just the beginning. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to belong to this group,\u201d considers Sara. \u201cI hope Annie captures our feelings very well: our positivity, our tenacity, our resilience. And that these superpowers will be forever remembered.\u201d From the mental to the physical, dive even deeper into these athletes\u2019 Picture of Health.

My Picture of Health is self belief,\u201d explains Chilean archer Mariana Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \u201cThis means I can be at my best in both life and my sport.\u201d\n\nMariana was born with myelomeningocele, a form of spina bifida. \u201cI first began archery when I was 10 years old after watching the movie Brave,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd today I\u2019m on a beautiful journey in sport.\u201d When she won a silver medal, her achievement was celebrated across the continent as the first archer from the Americas to win in her category.\n\n\u201cFor me, being brave means facing obstacles,\u201d she says. \u201cFeeling all of the fear and emotions, but at the same time facing the challenges that life throws at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Picture of Health is the strength to overcome difficulties that seemed impossible at first,\u201d says Polish shot put and club throw athlete, R\u00f3\u017ca Kozakowska. \u201cIn my case, impossible doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nR\u00f3\u017ca\u2019s nervous system was attacked after a tick bite and she developed articular and cerebral neuroborreliosis, a condition which impacts her coordination. \u201cI woke up one morning and just felt I was paralyzed,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I never gave up, I believed in myself, and this is how my adventure in sports for disabled people began.\u201d\n\nR\u00f3\u017ca not only won a gold medal in Tokyo 2020, but she also set a new world record and was named Poland\u2019s 2021 Disabled Athlete of the Year. \u201cDeveloping my physical fitness takes time, it is a hard, thorough process,\u201d she emphasizes. But it\u2019s worth it. \u201cWithout health, life is gray, boring, devoid of all color. It is the most important thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Picture of Health is determination,\u201d declares Richard Whitehead, MBE, and British runner. From an early age, Richard learned to live life without limits, becoming the first double amputee to run the length of Great Britain\u201440 marathons in 40 days for charity.\n\nSince winning two Paralympic gold medals for the 200 meters, Richard has devoted his energy to using the power of sport for the benefit of disabled people. \u201cProbably my greatest achievement was accepting my disability as not a negative, but as a positive,\u201d he says. \u201cAn opportunity to show people that anything is possible; to represent a community that maybe didn\u2019t have representation when I was growing up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Picture of Health is energy,\u201d says British Para athlete Emmanuel Oyinbo-Coker. \u201cI say energy because it\u2019s quite similar to health in terms of how contagious it is. If someone is in good health, they would tend to promote good health habits,\u201d he explains.\n\nMissing his lower left arm, Emmanuel\u2019s running skill was spotted by a teacher. \u201cI came second out of all the schools in my council,\u201d he recalls, and he was encouraged to take running seriously by following a Para athlete pathway. \u201cI\u2019m representing Great Britain; I\u2019ve won a Commonwealth gold medal. And yeah, the Paralympic medal is the next one to come,\u201d he smiles.\n\n\u201cSleeping good, eating good, exercising, drinking lots of water, if you have good energy, you\u2019re feeling buzzy, you\u2019re feeling happy,\u201d he says. \u201cThat ability to influence others through how you\u2019re feeling is very helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy picture of health is tranquility,\u201d explains Sara Andr\u00e9s Barrio, Spanish sprinter and long jumper. \u201cBecause when your health is good, you\u2019re whole, in peace, at ease with yourself.\u201d\n\nSara lost her feet in an accident, but she seized what she saw as a second chance and took up sport to become more agile. \u201cI realized I loved athletics. It became my passion, and now my profession.\u201d A finalist in Rio, and having won double bronze and silver medals at the World Para Athletics Championships, Sara has a clear focus on health.\n\n\u201cI think having good health is the main thing, right?\u201d she asks. \u201cTo be able to enjoy life, to be fully calm knowing that everything is fine in your body and mind, to be able to enjoy the things that really matter, right?\u201d\n\nThese extraordinary athletes have been photographed by world-renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz as part of Bupa's Picture of Health campaign. This aims to start a conversation about what health is, and what it can be\u2014using this series of dynamic and striking photos to inspire people to share their own pictures of health. From strength and independence to family and self-belief, these photos are just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to belong to this group,\u201d considers Sara. \u201cI hope Annie captures our feelings very well: our positivity, our tenacity, our resilience. And that these superpowers will be forever remembered.\u201d"

        "title": "Digestive System",
        "text": "Learn more about how we get energy from food. The digestive system is the series of tubelike organs that convert our meals into body fuel. There are about 30 feet (9 meters) of these convoluted pipeworks, starting with the mouth and ending with the anus. Along the way, food is broken down, sorted, and reprocessed before being circulated around the body to nourish and replace cells and supply energy to our muscles. Food on the plate must be converted into a mashed-up, gooey liquid for the digestive system to be able to split it up into its constituent parts: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Our teeth start the process by chewing and grinding up each mouthful, while the tongue works it into a ball-shaped bolus for swallowing. Moistening saliva fed into the mouth from nearby glands starts the process of chemical digestion using specialized proteins called enzymes. Secreted at various points along the digestive tract, enzymes break down large molecules of food into smaller molecules that the body is able to absorb. Once we swallow, digestion becomes involuntary. Food passes down the throat to the esophagus, the first of a succession of hollow organs that transport their contents through muscular contractions known as peristalsis. The esophagus empties into the stomach, a large, muscular chamber that mixes food up with digestive juices including the enzyme pepsin, which targets proteins, and lipase, which works on fats. Hydrochloric acid likewise helps to dissolve the stomach contents while killing potentially harmful bacteria. The resulting semifluid paste\u2014chyme\u2014is sealed in the stomach by two ringlike sphincter muscles for several hours and then released in short bursts into the duodenum. The first of three sections of the small intestine, the duodenum, produces large quantities of mucus to protect the intestinal lining from acid in the chyme.  Measuring about 20 feet (6 meters) in length, the small intestine is where the major digestion and absorption of nutrients take place. These nutrients are taken into the bloodstream, via millions of tiny, fingerlike projections called villi, and transported to the liver. What's left in the digestive tract passes into the large intestine, where it's eaten by billions of harmless bacteria and mixed with dead cells to form solid feces. Water is reabsorbed into the body while the feces are moved into the rectum to await expulsion. Other organs that play a key role in digestion include the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. The pancreas is a gland organ located behind the stomach that manufactures a cocktail of enzymes that are pumped into the duodenum. A duct also connects the duodenum to the gallbladder. This pear-shaped sac squeezes out green-brown bile, a waste product collected from the liver that contains acids for dissolving fatty matter. The liver itself is the body's main chemical factory, performing hundreds of different functions. It processes nutrients absorbed into the blood by the small intestine, creating energy-giving glycogen from sugary carbohydrates and converting dietary proteins into new proteins needed for our blood. These are then stored or released as needed, as are essential vitamins and minerals. The liver also breaks down unwanted chemicals, such as any alcohol consumed, which is detoxified and passed from the body as waste.

        "title": "Planet Mars, explained",
        "text": "The rusty world is full of mysteries\u2014and some of the solar system's most extreme geology. Learn more about Earth's smaller, colder neighbor. The red planet Mars, named for the Roman god of war, has long been an omen in the night sky. And in its own way, the planet\u2019s rusty red surface tells a story of destruction. Billions of years ago, the fourth planet from the sun could have been mistaken for Earth\u2019s smaller twin, with liquid water on its surface\u2014and maybe even life. Now, the world is a cold, barren desert with few signs of liquid water. But after decades of study using orbiters, landers, and rovers, scientists have revealed Mars as a dynamic, windblown landscape that could\u2014just maybe\u2014harbor microbial life beneath its rusty surface even today. With a radius of 2,106 miles, Mars is the seventh largest planet in our solar system and about half the diameter of Earth. Its surface gravity is 37.5 percent of Earth\u2019s. Mars rotates on its axis every 24.6 Earth hours, defining the length of a Martian day, which is called a sol (short for \u201csolar day\u201d). Mars\u2019s axis of rotation is tilted 25.2 degrees relative to the plane of the planet\u2019s orbit around the sun, which helps give Mars seasons similar to those on Earth. Whichever hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun experiences spring and summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets fall and winter. At two specific moments each year\u2014called the equinoxes\u2014both hemispheres receive equal illumination. But for several reasons, seasons on Mars are different from those on Earth. For one, Mars is on average about 50 percent farther from the sun than Earth is, with an average orbital distance of 142 million miles. This means that it takes Mars longer to complete a single orbit, stretching out its year and the lengths of its seasons. On Mars, a year lasts 669.6 sols, or 687 Earth days, and an individual season can last up to 194 sols, or just over 199 Earth days. The angle of Mars\u2019s axis of rotation also changes much more often than Earth's, which has led to swings in the Martian climate on timescales of thousands to millions of years. In addition, Mars\u2019s orbit is less circular than Earth\u2019s, which means that its orbital velocity varies more over the course of a Martian year. This annual variation affects the timing of the red planet\u2019s solstices and equinoxes. On Mars, the northern hemisphere\u2019s spring and summer are longer than the fall and winter. Ages 7-12 There\u2019s another complicating factor: Mars has a far thinner atmosphere than Earth, which dramatically lessens how much heat the planet can trap near its surface. Surface temperatures on Mars can reach as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit and as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit, but on average, its surface is -81 degrees Fahrenheit, a full 138 degrees colder than Earth\u2019s average temperature. The primary driver of modern Martian geology is its atmosphere, which is mostly made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. By Earth standards, the air is preposterously thin; air pressure atop Mount Everest is about 50 times higher than it is at the Martian surface. Despite the thin air, Martian breezes can gust up to 60 miles an hour, kicking up dust that fuels huge dust storms and massive fields of alien sand dunes. Once upon a time, though, wind and water flowed across the red planet. Robotic rovers have found clear evidence that billions of years ago, lakes and rivers of liquid water coursed across the red planet\u2019s surface. This means that at some point in the distant past, Mars\u2019s atmosphere was sufficiently dense and retained enough heat for water to remain liquid on the red planet\u2019s surface. Not so today: Though water ice abounds under the Martian surface and in its polar ice caps, there are no large bodies of liquid water on the surface there today. Mars also lacks an active plate tectonic system, the geologic engine that drives our active Earth, and is also missing a planetary magnetic field. The absence of this protective barrier makes it easier for the sun\u2019s high-energy particles to strip away the red planet\u2019s atmosphere, which may help explain why Mars\u2019s atmosphere is now so thin. But in the ancient past\u2014up until about 4.12 to 4.14 billion years ago\u2014Mars seems to have had an inner dynamo powering a planet-wide magnetic field. What shut down the Martian dynamo? Scientists are still trying to figure out. Like Earth and Venus, Mars has mountains, valleys, and volcanoes, but the red planet\u2019s are by far the biggest and most dramatic. Olympus Mons, the solar system\u2019s largest volcano, towers some 16 miles above the Martian surface, making it three times taller than Everest. But the base of Olympus Mons is so wide\u2014some 374 miles across\u2014that the volcano\u2019s average slope is only slightly steeper than a wheelchair ramp. The peak is so massive, it curves with the surface of Mars. If you stood at the outer edge of Olympus Mons, its summit would lie beyond the horizon. Mars has not only the highest highs, but also some of the solar system\u2019s lowest lows. Southeast of Olympus Mons lies Valles Marineris, the red planet\u2019s iconic canyon system. The gorges span about 2,500 miles and cut up to 4.3 miles into the red planet\u2019s surface. The network of chasms is four times deeper\u2014and five times longer\u2014than Earth\u2019s Grand Canyon, and at its widest, it\u2019s a staggering 200 miles across. The valleys get their name from Mariner 9, which became the first spacecraft to orbit another planet when it arrived at Mars in 1971. About 4.5 billion years ago, Mars coalesced from the gaseous, dusty disk that surrounded our young sun. Over time, the red planet\u2019s innards differentiated into a core, a mantle, and an outer crust that\u2019s an average of 40 miles thick. Its core is likely made of iron and nickel, like Earth\u2019s, but probably contains more sulfur than ours. The best available estimates suggest that the core is about 2,120 miles across, give or take 370 miles\u2014but we don\u2019t know the specifics. NASA\u2019s InSight lander aims to unravel the mysteries of Mars\u2019s interior by tracking how seismic waves move through the red planet. Mars\u2019s northern and southern hemispheres are wildly different from one another, to a degree unlike any other planet in the solar system. The planet\u2019s northern hemisphere consists mostly of low-lying plains, and the crust there can be just 19 miles thick. The highlands of the southern hemisphere, however, are studded with many extinct volcanoes, and the crust there can get up to 62 miles thick. What happened? It\u2019s possible that patterns of internal magma flow caused the difference, but some scientists think it's the result of Mars suffering one or several major impacts. One recent model suggests Mars got its two faces because an object the size of Earth\u2019s moon slammed into Mars near its south pole. Both hemispheres do have one thing in common: They\u2019re covered in the planet\u2019s trademark dust, which gets its many shades of orange, red, and brown from iron rust. At some point in the distant past, the red planet gained its two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. The two lumpy worlds, discovered in 1877, are named for the sons and chariot drivers of the god Mars in Roman mythology. How the moons formed remains unsolved. One possibility is that they formed in the asteroid belt and were captured by Mars\u2019s gravity. But recent models instead suggest that they could have formed from the debris flung up from Mars after a huge impact long ago. Deimos, the smaller of the two moons, orbits Mars every 30 hours and is less than 10 miles across. Its larger sibling Phobos bears many scars, including craters and deep grooves running across its surface. Scientists have long debated what caused the grooves on Phobos. Are they tracks left behind by boulders rolling across the surface after an ancient impact, or signs that Mars\u2019s gravity is pulling the moon apart? Either way, the moon\u2019s future will be considerably less groovy. Each century, Phobos gets about six feet closer to Mars; in 50 million years or so, the moon is projected either to crash into the red planet\u2019s surface or break into smithereens. Since the 1960s, humans have robotically explored Mars more than any other planet beyond Earth. Currently, eight missions from the U.S., European Union, Russia, and India are actively orbiting Mars or roving across its surface. But getting safely to the red planet is no small feat. Of the 45 Mars missions launched since 1960, 26 have had some component fail to leave Earth, fall silent en route, miss orbit around Mars, burn up in the atmosphere, crash on the surface, or die prematurely. More missions are on the horizon, including some designed to help search for Martian life. NASA is building its Mars 2020 rover to cache promising samples of Martian rock that a future mission would return to Earth. In 2020, the European Space Agency and Roscosmos plan to launch a rover named for chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial to deciphering the structure of DNA. The rover will drill into Martian soil to hunt for signs of past and present life. Other countries are joining the fray, making space exploration more global in the process. In July 2020, the United Arab Emirates is slated to launch its Hope orbiter, which will study the Martian atmosphere. Perhaps humans will one day join robots on the red planet. NASA has stated its goal to send humans back to the moon as a stepping-stone to Mars. Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, is building a massive vehicle called Starship in part to send humans to Mars. Will humans eventually build a scientific base on the Martian surface, like those that dot Antarctica? How will human activity affect the red planet or our searches for life there? Time will tell. But no matter what, Mars will continue to occupy the human imagination, a glimmering red beacon in our skies and stories.

Mars\u2019s axis of rotation is tilted 25.2 degrees relative to the plane of the planet\u2019s orbit around the sun, which helps give Mars seasons similar to those on Earth.\n\nWhichever hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun experiences spring and summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets fall and winter. At two specific moments each year\u2014called the equinoxes\u2014both hemispheres receive equal illumination. But for several reasons, seasons on Mars are different from those on Earth. For one, Mars is on average about 50 percent farther from the sun than Earth is, with an average orbital distance of 142 million miles.\n\nThis means that it takes Mars longer to complete a single orbit, stretching out its year and the lengths of its seasons. On Mars, a year lasts 669.6 sols, or 687 Earth days, and an individual season can last up to 194 sols, or just over 199 Earth days. The angle of Mars\u2019s axis of rotation also changes much more often than Earth's, which has led to swings in the Martian climate on timescales of thousands to millions of years.\n\nIn addition, Mars\u2019s orbit is less circular than Earth\u2019s, which means that its orbital velocity varies more over the course of a Martian year. This annual variation affects the timing of the red planet\u2019s solstices and equinoxes. On Mars, the northern hemisphere\u2019s spring and summer are longer than the fall and winter.\n\nSurface temperatures on Mars can reach as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit and as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit, but on average, its surface is -81 degrees Fahrenheit, a full 138 degrees colder than Earth\u2019s average temperature. The primary driver of modern Martian geology is its atmosphere, which is mostly made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.\n\nBy Earth standards, the air is preposterously thin; air pressure atop Mount Everest is about 50 times higher than it is at the Martian surface. Despite the thin air, Martian breezes can gust up to 60 miles an hour, kicking up dust that fuels huge dust storms and massive fields of alien sand dunes.\n\nOnce upon a time, though, wind and water flowed across the red planet. Robotic rovers have found clear evidence that billions of years ago, lakes and rivers of liquid water coursed across the red planet\u2019s surface. This means that at some point in the distant past, Mars\u2019s atmosphere was sufficiently dense and retained enough heat for water to remain liquid on the red planet\u2019s surface.\n\nNot so today: Though water ice abounds under the Martian surface and in its polar ice caps, there are no large bodies of liquid water on the surface there today. Mars also lacks an active plate tectonic system, the geologic engine that drives our active Earth, and is also missing a planetary magnetic field.\n\nThe absence of this protective barrier makes it easier for the sun\u2019s high-energy particles to strip away the red planet\u2019s atmosphere, which may help explain why Mars\u2019s atmosphere is now so thin. But in the ancient past\u2014up until about 4.12 to 4.14 billion years ago\u2014Mars seems to have had an inner dynamo powering a planet-wide magnetic field.\n\nWhat shut down the Martian dynamo? Scientists are still trying to figure out. Like Earth and Venus, Mars has mountains, valleys, and volcanoes, but the red planet\u2019s are by far the biggest and most dramatic. Olympus Mons, the solar system\u2019s largest volcano, towers some 16 miles above the Martian surface, making it three times taller than Everest.\n\nBut the base of Olympus Mons is so wide\u2014some 374 miles across\u2014that the volcano\u2019s average slope is only slightly steeper than a wheelchair ramp. The peak is so massive, it curves with the surface of Mars. If you stood at the outer edge of Olympus Mons, its summit would lie beyond the horizon.\n\nMars has not only the highest highs, but also some of the solar system\u2019s lowest lows. Southeast of Olympus Mons lies Valles Marineris, the red planet\u2019s iconic canyon system. The gorges span about 2,500 miles and cut up to 4.3 miles into the red planet\u2019s surface.\n\nThe network of chasms is four times deeper\u2014and five times longer\u2014than Earth\u2019s Grand Canyon, and at its widest, it\u2019s a staggering 200 miles across. The valleys get their name from Mariner 9, which became the first spacecraft to orbit another planet when it arrived at Mars in 1971.\n\nAbout 4.5 billion years ago, Mars coalesced from the gaseous, dusty disk that surrounded our young sun. Over time, the red planet\u2019s innards differentiated into a core, a mantle, and an outer crust that\u2019s an average of 40 miles thick. Its core is likely made of iron and nickel, like Earth\u2019s, but probably contains more sulfur than ours.\n\nThe best available estimates suggest that the core is about 2,120 miles across, give or take 370 miles\u2014but we don\u2019t know the specifics. NASA\u2019s InSight lander aims to unravel the mysteries of Mars\u2019s interior by tracking how seismic waves move through the red planet.\n\nMars\u2019s northern and southern hemispheres are wildly different from one another, to a degree unlike any other planet in the solar system. The planet\u2019s northern hemisphere consists mostly of low-lying plains, and the crust there can be just 19 miles thick. The highlands of the southern hemisphere, however, are studded with many extinct volcanoes, and the crust there can get up to 62 miles thick.\n\nWhat happened? It\u2019s possible that patterns of internal magma flow caused the difference, but some scientists think it's the result of Mars suffering one or several major impacts. One recent model suggests Mars got its two faces because an object the size of Earth\u2019s moon slammed into Mars near its south pole.\n\nBoth hemispheres do have one thing in common: They\u2019re covered in the planet\u2019s trademark dust, which gets its many shades of orange, red, and brown from iron rust. At some point in the distant past, the red planet gained its two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\nThe two lumpy worlds, discovered in 1877, are named for the sons and chariot drivers of the god Mars in Roman mythology. How the moons formed remains unsolved. One possibility is that they formed in the asteroid belt and were captured by Mars\u2019s gravity. But recent models instead suggest that they could have formed from the debris flung up from Mars after a huge impact long ago.\n\nDeimos, the smaller of the two moons, orbits Mars every 30 hours and is less than 10 miles across. Its larger sibling Phobos bears many scars, including craters and deep grooves running across its surface. Scientists have long debated what caused the grooves on Phobos.\n\nAre they tracks left behind by boulders rolling across the surface after an ancient impact, or signs that Mars\u2019s gravity is pulling the moon apart? Either way, the moon\u2019s future will be considerably less groovy. Each century, Phobos gets about six feet closer to Mars; in 50 million years or so, the moon is projected either to crash into the red planet\u2019s surface or break into smithereens.\n\nSince the 1960s, humans have robotically explored Mars more than any other planet beyond Earth. Currently, eight missions from the U.S., European Union, Russia, and India are actively orbiting Mars or roving across its surface. But getting safely to the red planet is no small feat.\n\nOf the 45 Mars missions launched since 1960, 26 have had some component fail to leave Earth, fall silent en route, miss orbit around Mars, burn up in the atmosphere, crash on the surface, or die prematurely. More missions are on the horizon, including some designed to help search for Martian life.\n\nNASA is building its Mars 2020 rover to cache promising samples of Martian rock that a future mission would return to Earth. In 2020, the European Space Agency and Roscosmos plan to launch a rover named for chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial to deciphering the structure of DNA.\n\nThe rover will drill into Martian soil to hunt for signs of past and present life. Other countries are joining the fray, making space exploration more global in the process. In July 2020, the United Arab Emirates is slated to launch its Hope orbiter, which will study the Martian atmosphere.\n\nPerhaps humans will one day join robots on the red planet. NASA has stated its goal to send humans back to the moon as a stepping-stone to Mars. Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, is building a massive vehicle called Starship in part to send humans to Mars.\n\nWill humans eventually build a scientific base on the Martian surface, like those that dot Antarctica? How will human activity affect the red planet or our searches for life there? Time will tell. But no matter what, Mars will continue to occupy the human imagination, a glimmering red beacon in our skies and stories."

There are a few handfuls of major plates and dozens of smaller, or minor, plates. Six of the majors are named for the continents embedded within them, such as the North American, African, and Antarctic plates. Though smaller in size, the minors are no less important when it comes to shaping the Earth. The tiny Juan de Fuca plate is largely responsible for the volcanoes that dot the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The plates make up Earth's outer shell, called the lithosphere. (This includes the crust and uppermost part of the mantle.) Churning currents in the molten rocks below propel them along like a jumble of conveyor belts in disrepair. Most geologic activity stems from the interplay where the plates meet or divide. The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other. They move at a rate of one to two inches (three to five centimeters) per year.  Where plates serving landmasses collide, the crust crumples and buckles into mountain ranges. India and Asia crashed about 55 million years ago, slowly giving rise to the Himalaya, the highest mountain system on Earth. As the mash-up continues, the mountains get higher. Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, may be a tiny bit taller tomorrow than it is today. These convergent boundaries also occur where a plate of ocean dives, in a process called subduction, under a landmass. As the overlying plate lifts up, it also forms mountain ranges. In addition, the diving plate melts and is often spewed out in volcanic eruptions such as those that formed some of the mountains in the Andes of South America. At ocean-ocean convergences, one plate usually dives beneath the other, forming deep trenches like the Mariana Trench in the North Pacific Ocean, the deepest point on Earth. These types of collisions can also lead to underwater volcanoes that eventually build up into island arcs like Japan. At divergent boundaries in the oceans, magma from deep in the Earth's mantle rises toward the surface and pushes apart two or more plates. Mountains and volcanoes rise along the seam. The process renews the ocean floor and widens the giant basins. A single mid-ocean ridge system connects the world's oceans, making the ridge the longest mountain range in the world. On land, giant troughs such as the Great Rift Valley in Africa form where plates are tugged apart.

        "title": "The Permian extinction\u2014when life nearly came to an end",
        "text": "A quarter of a billion years ago, long before dinosaurs or mammals evolved, the predator Dinogorgon, whose skull is shown here, hunted floodplains in the heart of today's South Africa. In less than a million years Dinogorgon vanished in the greatest mass extinction ever, along with about nine of every 10 plant and animal species on the planet. This mass extinction almost ended life on Earth as we know it. \"Welcome to the Black Triangle,\" said paleobiologist Cindy Looy as our van slowed to a stop in the gentle hills of the northern Czech Republic, a few miles from the German and Polish borders. The Black Triangle gets its name from the coal burned by nearby power plants. Decades of acid rain generated by power-plant emissions have devastated the region's ecosystems. Yet the treeless hills looked healthy and green. I tried to hide my surprise. For months I'd been on the trail of the greatest natural disaster in Earth's history. About 250 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, something killed some 90 percent of the planet's species. Less than 5 percent of the animal species in the seas survived. On land less than a third of the large animal species made it. Nearly all the trees died. Looy had told me that the Black Triangle was the best place today to see what the world would have looked like after the Permian extinction. This didn't look like apocalypse. We saw the first signs of death as we walked into the hills\u2014hundreds of fallen timbers lay hidden in the undergrowth. A forest once grew here. Half a mile (0.8 kilometers) uphill we found the trunks of a stand of spruce, killed by acid rain. No birds called, no insects hummed. The only sound was the wind through the acid-tolerant weeds. \"The forest that grew here a few decades ago contained dozens of species of plants,\" said Looy. \"Now there are only a few grassy species.\" Looy picked up a spruce cone. Pollen from the trees around us might be preserved inside. She believes that the Permian extinction was caused by acid rain following a massive release of volcanic gases. She wants to compare tree pollen from a modern forest killed by acid rain with fossil pollen found in Permian rocks. Like a homicide detective at a crime scene, Looy sealed the cone in a plastic bag for later lab work. \"You could say we're working on the greatest murder mystery of all time,\" she said. Ages 7-12 Looy is one of many scientists trying to identify the killer responsible for the largest of the many mass extinctions that have struck the planet. The most famous die-off ended the reign of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. Most researchers consider that case closed. Rocks of that age contain traces of an asteroid that struck Earth, generating catastrophic events from global wildfires to climate change. But the Permian detectives are faced with a host of suspects and not enough evidence to convict any of them. To understand this extinction, I wanted first to get a sense of its scale. That's difficult\u2014sediments containing fossils from the end of the Permian are rare and often inaccessible. One site that preserves the extinction's victims lies about a half day's drive inland from Cape Town, South Africa, in a scrubland known as the Karoo. \"The Karoo is the kind of place where people fall asleep at the wheel,\" said Roger Smith, a paleontologist at the South African Museum, as we drove across the treeless land. \"But it may be the best place to see the terrestrial realm's transition from the Permian to the Triassic period.\" We ascended through sheep-ranching country toward the Lootsberg Pass. The rocks that surrounded us date from the late Permian. For every yard of altitude we gained, we traveled tens of thousands of years forward in time, heading for the Permian's conclusion. If we had driven here before the extinction, we would have seen animals as abundant and diverse as those of today's Serengeti, except most would have belonged to a group known as synapsids. Often called mammal-like reptiles\u2014they looked like a cross between a dog and a lizard\u2014the synapsids were Earth's first great dynasty of land vertebrates. \"We've found fossils of many kinds of synapsids in these rocks, especially tortoise-beaked dicynodonts, which likely lived in herds and browsed on vegetation along the riverbanks,\" said Smith. \"There were also a lot of smaller grazers and root grubbers, like Diictodon, a dachshund-shaped dicynodont that probably dug up roots and shoots. They were preyed upon by gorgonopsians\u2014fleet-footed synapsid carnivores with needle-sharp teeth.\" The late Permian rocks we passed as we neared Lootsberg Pass capture the synapsids at the height of their reign. For more than 60 million years they were Earth's dominant land vertebrates, occupying the same ecological niches as their successors, the dinosaurs. Smith slowed at a switchback, rolled down the window, and pointed to a horizontally banded cliff. \"See that road cut?\" he asked. \"That's your Permo-Triassic transition zone. Brace yourself, you're about to go through the extinction.\" The fossils embedded in this road cut suggest that synapsids took a savage hit at the end of the Permian. A synapsid known as Lystrosaurus appears in these sediments. Smith had a skull of the animal in his truck. Its flat face gave it the look of a bulldog with tusks. In the first few yards of the transition zone, only one or two Lystrosaurus fossils have been found scattered among all the diverse late Permian animals. Higher up, the diversity suddenly dwindles. Dozens of species of Permian synapsids disappear, leaving Lystrosaurus and a few others in early Triassic rocks. Animals were still abundant, but the community they formed was about as species rich as a cornfield. Plants were also hit by the extinction. Evidence for the scale of damage to the world's forests comes from the Italian Alps. I joined a research team led by Henk Visscher of the University of Utrecht at the Butterloch gorge, where exposed fossil beds cover the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. The beds lie high on a cliff, accessible only by climbing piles of debris. I anxiously followed veteran climber Mark Sephton up a slope of loose rocks to a ledge. Sephton used his hammer to chip bits of rock from the layers that chronicle the extinction. Each fragment contains microscopic fossils\u2014pieces of plants and fungi. The lower layers, dating from prior to the extinction, contain lots of pollen, typical of a healthy conifer forest. But in rocks from the Permo-Triassic boundary the pollen is replaced by strands of fossilized fungi\u2014as many as a million segments in some golf-ball-size rocks. All that fungi in boundary rocks may represent an exploding population of scavengers feasting on an epic meal of dead trees. \"We think it's a wood-decaying fungus,\" says Looy, who works with Visscher. \"When a tree dies, it falls. As it decays, fungi grow into it from spores on the ground, decomposing it.\" Visscher and his colleagues have found elevated levels of fungal remains in Permo-Triassic rocks from all over the world. They call it a \"fungal spike.\" The same rocks yield few tree pollen grains. Visscher's conclusion: Nearly all the world's trees died en masse. On the drive from Butterloch a team member handed me a soft, brown banana\u2014a leftover from lunch. \"This is how you can imagine the Permian extinction,\" he said. \"Rotting biomass.\" \"It's not easy to kill so many species,\" says Doug Erwin, a Smithsonian Institution paleontologist. \"It had to be something catastrophic.\" Erwin and geologist Samuel Bowring of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have dated volcanic ash in Chinese sediments laid down during the extinction. Bowring thinks the extinction took place in as little as 100,000 years\u2014quicker than the click of a camera shutter on a geologic scale of time. Suspects must be capable of killing with staggering swiftness both on land and in the seas. As I spoke with some of the researchers on the killer's trail, I learned how many suspects there are\u2014and how difficult it is to develop a tight case. An enormous asteroid impact is the prime suspect of Gregory Retallack, a geologist at the University of Oregon. The collision would have sent billions of particles into the atmosphere, he explains. They would have spread around the planet, then rained down on land and sea. Retallack has discovered tiny quartz crystals marked with microscopic fractures in rocks from the time of the extinction in Australia and Antarctica. \"You need staggering force, many times greater than a nuclear explosion, to create this shocked quartz,\" said Retallack. \"Only an impact could deform it this way.\" A team of researchers recently found what may be that impact's footprint buried below Australia\u2014a 75-mile-wide (120-kilometer-wide) crater left by an asteroid more than three miles (4.8 kilometers) across. I asked Retallack what an impact would be like if we had been standing a few hundred miles from ground zero. \"You'd feel a shudder,\" he replied. \"Clouds of noxious gases would billow in and block out the sun for months. Temperatures would drop, and corrosive acid snow and rain would fall. After the clouds cleared, the atmosphere would be thick with carbon dioxide from fires and decaying matter. CO2 is a greenhouse gas; it would have contributed to global warming that lasted millions of years.\" The short-term effects alone\u2014cold, darkness, and acid rain\u2014would kill plants and photosynthetic plankton, the base of most food chains. Herbivores would starve, as would the carnivores that fed on the plant-eaters. Other Permian detectives suspect the killer oozed up from the sea. For years scientists have known that the deep ocean lacked oxygen in the late Permian. But most life is concentrated in shallow water, in places like reefs. In 1996 English geologists Paul Wignall and Richard Twitchett of the University of Leeds reported the first evidence of oxygen depletion, or anoxia, in rocks that formed under shallow water at the time of the extinction. Pollution sometimes turns waters anoxic today in regions that lack good circulation. Local die-offs of marine life can result. But Wignall suspects that the entire ocean may have stagnated in Permian times. What could still the currents that oxygenate the ocean? Perhaps a lack of ice caps during the late Permian led to the stagnation. Normally temperature differences between polar and equatorial waters create convective currents. Without those currents, anoxic water could have built up, spilling into shallow water as sea levels rose and smothering marine life. Permian oceans also might have been poisoned with CO2, according to Andrew Knoll, a paleobiologist at Harvard. Oceanic bacteria eat organic matter, producing bicarbonate as a digestive by-product. Without currents, the load of bicarbonate could have grown in the deep ocean. Knoll thinks something big\u2014he's not sure what\u2014disturbed the seas. Bicarbonate-laden water rose from below, he suggests. As it did, it depressurized. Dissolved bicarbonate was released as CO2, making the seas bubble at times like a glass of soda. The crisis for marine animals would have started when toxic levels of CO2 entered the shallows. Fish would have grown lethargic and slowly fallen asleep. \"Perhaps the Permian ended with a whimper and not a bang,\" said Knoll. Another suspect\u2014a deadly epoch of volcanic eruptions\u2014left a million-square-mile (2.6-million-square-kilometer) fingerprint in Siberia. Below the town of Norilsk lies a two-and-a-half-mile-thick (four-kilometer-thick) pile of lava, overgrown by conifers. Geologists call this vast lava field the Siberian Traps. It wasn't produced by one volcano. \"Thick, pulsing flows of glowing magma gushed out from numerous broad, flat volcanoes,\" said geologist Paul Renne of the Berkeley Geochronology Center. \"Hundreds of cubic miles spread across Siberia\u2014enough to cover the Earth to a depth of about 20 feet (6 meters).\" For decades scientists have known the Siberian Traps were formed around the time of the Permian extinction. Could the greatest extinction be related to the greatest volcanic eruptions? Renne, an expert at determining the ages of rocks, has been trying to work out the timing of the events. His lab is filled with machines\u2014tangles of high-voltage cables, vacuum lines, and stainless steel\u2014that date rocks by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes within them. Renne secured chunks of lava from the Siberian Traps and Permo-Triassic boundary rocks from China. He has determined the two events occurred within 100,000 years of each other. Renne doubts that's a coincidence. But the Siberian Traps volcanoes didn't cause the extinction by swamping the world with lava. As volcanic gases poured into the skies, they would have generated acid rain, and sulfate molecules would have blocked sunlight and cooled the planet. Glaciation would have reduced the volume of water in the ocean, storing it as ice. Sea level would have dropped, killing marine life in the shallows and severely reducing diversity. Lowering sea level can also release the ocean's methane, which, combined with CO2 from the eruptions and decaying organic matter, would likely produce greenhouse conditions. \"In 1783 a volcano called Laki erupted in Iceland,\" said Renne. \"Within a year global temperature dropped almost two degrees. Imagine a Laki erupting every year for hundreds of thousands of years.\" Each scientist I met left me thinking that he or she was a clue or two away from solving the crime. But as Doug Erwin of the Smithsonian cautioned me, \"the truth is sometimes untidy.\" The Permian extinction reminds him of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, in which a corpse with 12 knife wounds is discovered on a train. Twelve different killers conspired to slay the victim. Erwin suspects there may have been multiple killers at the end of the Permian. Maybe everything\u2014eruptions, an impact, anoxia\u2014went wrong at once. Could it happen again? \"Sure,\" Erwin replied. \"The question is when. Tomorrow? A hundred million years from now?\" I left Erwin's office at the Smithsonian and wandered into the dinosaur hall. Behind the dinosaurs was a case with skulls of Permian synapsids. They don't get many visitors. Lystrosaurus, the synapsid that inherited the barren world of the Triassic, stared out empty-eyed. With its competition gone, Lystrosaurus spread across the world, from Russia to Antarctica. Death creates opportunity. Survivors occupy vacant niches. Within a million years synapsid diversity recovered. One lineage produced our ancestors, the first mammals. Now we are creating a new mass extinction, wiping out countless species. Will life be as resilient this time? I remembered the acid-tolerant plants of the Black Triangle, where we've done so much to destroy an ecosystem. If life can survive the Permian extinction, it can survive anything. Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

She wants to compare tree pollen from a modern forest killed by acid rain with fossil pollen found in Permian rocks.\n\nLike a homicide detective at a crime scene, Looy sealed the cone in a plastic bag for later lab work. \"You could say we're working on the greatest murder mystery of all time,\" she said.\n\nLooy is one of many scientists trying to identify the killer responsible for the largest of the many mass extinctions that have struck the planet. The most famous die-off ended the reign of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. Most researchers consider that case closed. Rocks of that age contain traces of an asteroid that struck Earth, generating catastrophic events from global wildfires to climate change. But the Permian detectives are faced with a host of suspects and not enough evidence to convict any of them.\n\nTo understand this extinction, I wanted first to get a sense of its scale. That's difficult\u2014sediments containing fossils from the end of the Permian are rare and often inaccessible. One site that preserves the extinction's victims lies about a half day's drive inland from Cape Town, South Africa, in a scrubland known as the Karoo.\n\n\"The Karoo is the kind of place where people fall asleep at the wheel,\" said Roger Smith, a paleontologist at the South African Museum, as we drove across the treeless land. \"But it may be the best place to see the terrestrial realm's transition from the Permian to the Triassic period.\"\n\nWe ascended through sheep-ranching country toward the Lootsberg Pass. The rocks that surrounded us date from the late Permian. For every yard of altitude we gained, we traveled tens of thousands of years forward in time, heading for the Permian's conclusion. If we had driven here before the extinction, we would have seen animals as abundant and diverse as those of today's Serengeti, except most would have belonged to a group known as synapsids.\n\nOften called mammal-like reptiles\u2014they looked like a cross between a dog and a lizard\u2014the synapsids were Earth's first great dynasty of land vertebrates. \"We've found fossils of many kinds of synapsids in these rocks, especially tortoise-beaked dicynodonts, which likely lived in herds and browsed on vegetation along the riverbanks,\" said Smith. \"There were also a lot of smaller grazers and root grubbers, like Diictodon, a dachshund-shaped dicynodont that probably dug up roots and shoots. They were preyed upon by gorgonopsians\u2014fleet-footed synapsid carnivores with needle-sharp teeth.\"\n\nThe late Permian rocks we passed as we neared Lootsberg Pass capture the synapsids at the height of their reign. For more than 60 million years they were Earth's dominant land vertebrates, occupying the same ecological niches as their successors, the dinosaurs. Smith slowed at a switchback, rolled down the window, and pointed to a horizontally banded cliff. \"See that road cut?\" he asked. \"That's your Permo-Triassic transition zone. Brace yourself, you're about to go through the extinction.\"\n\nThe fossils embedded in this road cut suggest that synapsids took a savage hit at the end of the Permian. A synapsid known as Lystrosaurus appears in these sediments. Smith had a skull of the animal in his truck. Its flat face gave it the look of a bulldog with tusks. In the first few yards of the transition zone, only one or two Lystrosaurus fossils have been found scattered among all the diverse late Permian animals. Higher up, the diversity suddenly dwindles. Dozens of species of Permian synapsids disappear, leaving Lystrosaurus and a few others in early Triassic rocks. Animals were still abundant, but the community they formed was about as species rich as a cornfield.\n\nPlants were also hit by the extinction. Evidence for the scale of damage to the world's forests comes from the Italian Alps. I joined a research team led by Henk Visscher of the University of Utrecht at the Butterloch gorge, where exposed fossil beds cover the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. The beds lie high on a cliff, accessible only by climbing piles of debris. I anxiously followed veteran climber Mark Sephton up a slope of loose rocks to a ledge. Sephton used his hammer to chip bits of rock from the layers that chronicle the extinction. Each fragment contains microscopic fossils\u2014pieces of plants and fungi.\n\nThe lower layers, dating from prior to the extinction, contain lots of pollen, typical of a healthy conifer forest. But in rocks from the Permo-Triassic boundary the pollen is replaced by strands of fossilized fungi\u2014as many as a million segments in some golf-ball-size rocks. All that fungi in boundary rocks may represent an exploding population of scavengers feasting on an epic meal of dead trees. \"We think it's a wood-decaying fungus,\" says Looy, who works with Visscher. \"When a tree dies, it falls. As it decays, fungi grow into it from spores on the ground, decomposing it.\"\n\nVisscher and his colleagues have found elevated levels of fungal remains in Permo-Triassic rocks from all over the world. They call it a \"fungal spike.\" The same rocks yield few tree pollen grains. Visscher's conclusion: Nearly all the world's trees died en masse. On the drive from Butterloch a team member handed me a soft, brown banana\u2014a leftover from lunch. \"This is how you can imagine the Permian extinction,\" he said. \"Rotting biomass.\"\n\n\"It's not easy to kill so many species,\" says Doug Erwin, a Smithsonian Institution paleontologist. \"It had to be something catastrophic.\" Erwin and geologist Samuel Bowring of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have dated volcanic ash in Chinese sediments laid down during the extinction. Bowring thinks the extinction took place in as little as 100,000 years\u2014quicker than the click of a camera shutter on a geologic scale of time. Suspects must be capable of killing with staggering swiftness both on land and in the seas.\n\nAs I spoke with some of the researchers on the killer's trail, I learned how many suspects there are\u2014and how difficult it is to develop a tight case. An enormous asteroid impact is the prime suspect of Gregory Retallack, a geologist at the University of Oregon. The collision would have sent billions of particles into the atmosphere, he explains. They would have spread around the planet, then rained down on land and sea. Retallack has discovered tiny quartz crystals marked with microscopic fractures in rocks from the time of the extinction in Australia and Antarctica. \"You need staggering force, many times greater than a nuclear explosion, to create this shocked quartz,\" said Retallack. \"Only an impact could deform it this way.\"\n\nA team of researchers recently found what may be that impact's footprint buried below Australia\u2014a 75-mile-wide (120-kilometer-wide) crater left by an asteroid more than three miles (4.8 kilometers) across. I asked Retallack what an impact would be like if we had been standing a few hundred miles from ground zero. \"You'd feel a shudder,\" he replied. \"Clouds of noxious gases would billow in and block out the sun for months. Temperatures would drop, and corrosive acid snow and rain would fall. After the clouds cleared, the atmosphere would be thick with carbon dioxide from fires and decaying matter. CO2 is a greenhouse gas; it would have contributed to global warming that lasted millions of years.\"\n\nThe short-term effects alone\u2014cold, darkness, and acid rain\u2014would kill plants and photosynthetic plankton, the base of most food chains. Herbivores would starve, as would the carnivores that fed on the plant-eaters. Other Permian detectives suspect the killer oozed up from the sea. For years scientists have known that the deep ocean lacked oxygen in the late Permian. But most life is concentrated in shallow water, in places like reefs. In 1996 English geologists Paul Wignall and Richard Twitchett of the University of Leeds reported the first evidence of oxygen depletion, or anoxia, in rocks that formed under shallow water at the time of the extinction.\n\nPollution sometimes turns waters anoxic today in regions that lack good circulation. Local die-offs of marine life can result. But Wignall suspects that the entire ocean may have stagnated in Permian times. What could still the currents that oxygenate the ocean? Perhaps a lack of ice caps during the late Permian led to the stagnation. Normally temperature differences between polar and equatorial waters create convective currents. Without those currents, anoxic water could have built up, spilling into shallow water as sea levels rose and smothering marine life.\n\nPermian oceans also might have been poisoned with CO2, according to Andrew Knoll, a paleobiologist at Harvard. Oceanic bacteria eat organic matter, producing bicarbonate as a digestive by-product. Without currents, the load of bicarbonate could have grown in the deep ocean. Knoll thinks something big\u2014he's not sure what\u2014disturbed the seas. Bicarbonate-laden water rose from below, he suggests. As it did, it depressurized. Dissolved bicarbonate was released as CO2, making the seas bubble at times like a glass of soda. The crisis for marine animals would have started when toxic levels of CO2 entered the shallows. Fish would have grown lethargic and slowly fallen asleep. \"Perhaps the Permian ended with a whimper and not a bang,\" said Knoll.\n\nAnother suspect\u2014a deadly epoch of volcanic eruptions\u2014left a million-square-mile (2.6-million-square-kilometer) fingerprint in Siberia. Below the town of Norilsk lies a two-and-a-half-mile-thick (four-kilometer-thick) pile of lava, overgrown by conifers. Geologists call this vast lava field the Siberian Traps. It wasn't produced by one volcano. \"Thick, pulsing flows of glowing magma gushed out from numerous broad, flat volcanoes,\" said geologist Paul Renne of the Berkeley Geochronology Center. \"Hundreds of cubic miles spread across Siberia\u2014enough to cover the Earth to a depth of about 20 feet (6 meters).\"\n\nFor decades scientists have known the Siberian Traps were formed around the time of the Permian extinction. Could the greatest extinction be related to the greatest volcanic eruptions? Renne, an expert at determining the ages of rocks, has been trying to work out the timing of the events. His lab is filled with machines\u2014tangles of high-voltage cables, vacuum lines, and stainless steel\u2014that date rocks by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes within them. Renne secured chunks of lava from the Siberian Traps and Permo-Triassic boundary rocks from China. He has determined the two events occurred within 100,000 years of each other. Renne doubts that's a coincidence.\n\nBut the Siberian Traps volcanoes didn't cause the extinction by swamping the world with lava. As volcanic gases poured into the skies, they would have generated acid rain, and sulfate molecules would have blocked sunlight and cooled the planet. Glaciation would have reduced the volume of water in the ocean, storing it as ice. Sea level would have dropped, killing marine life in the shallows and severely reducing diversity. Lowering sea level can also release the ocean's methane, which, combined with CO2 from the eruptions and decaying organic matter, would likely produce greenhouse conditions.\n\n\"In 1783 a volcano called Laki erupted in Iceland,\" said Renne. \"Within a year global temperature dropped almost two degrees. Imagine a Laki erupting every year for hundreds of thousands of years.\"\n\nEach scientist I met left me thinking that he or she was a clue or two away from solving the crime. But as Doug Erwin of the Smithsonian cautioned me, \"the truth is sometimes untidy.\" The Permian extinction reminds him of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, in which a corpse with 12 knife wounds is discovered on a train. Twelve different killers conspired to slay the victim. Erwin suspects there may have been multiple killers at the end of the Permian. Maybe everything\u2014eruptions, an impact, anoxia\u2014went wrong at once. Could it happen again? \"Sure,\" Erwin replied. \"The question is when. Tomorrow? A hundred million years from now?\"\n\nI left Erwin's office at the Smithsonian and wandered into the dinosaur hall. Behind the dinosaurs was a case with skulls of Permian synapsids. They don't get many visitors. Lystrosaurus, the synapsid that inherited the barren world of the Triassic, stared out empty-eyed. With its competition gone, Lystrosaurus spread across the world, from Russia to Antarctica. Death creates opportunity. Survivors occupy vacant niches. Within a million years synapsid diversity recovered. One lineage produced our ancestors, the first mammals. Now we are creating a new mass extinction, wiping out countless species. Will life be as resilient this time? I remembered the acid-tolerant plants of the Black Triangle, where we've done so much to destroy an ecosystem. If life can survive the Permian extinction, it can survive anything."

The great supercontinent of Gondwana was headed steadily northward, away from the South Pole, and a second supercontinent began to form that straddled the Equator. Known as Euramerica, or Laurussia, it was created by the coming together of parts of North America, northern Europe, Russia, and Greenland. Red-colored sediments, generated when North America collided with Europe, give the Devonian its name, as these distinguishing rocks were first studied in Devon, England. The Devonian, part of the Paleozoic era, is otherwise known as the Age of Fishes, as it spawned a remarkable variety of fish. The most formidable of them were the armored placoderms, a group that first appeared during the Silurian with powerful jaws lined with bladelike plates that acted as teeth. Early placoderms fed on mollusks and other invertebrates, but later species developed into ferocious, fish-slicing monsters measuring up to 33 feet (10 meters) long. Other types of bone-plated fish that lacked jaws developed a range of bizarre forms. Fossil specimens include species with horseshoe-shaped heads and others that looked like rounded shields. Despite their heavy protection, these primitive fishes weren't built to last. The Devonian ancestors of fishes living today belonged to two main nonarmored groups. The cartilaginous fish, so-called because cartilage formed their skeletons, later gave rise to sharks and rays. They had small, rough scales, fixed fins, and sharp, replaceable teeth. The second group, the bony fish, were covered in scales and had maneuverable fins and gas-filled swim bladders for controlling their buoyancy. Most modern fishes are bony fish. The bony fish included lobefins. Named after the thick, fleshy base to their fins, lobefins are credited with the giant evolutionary stride that led to the amphibians, making lobefins the ancestors of all four-limbed land vertebrates, including dinosaurs and mammals. The fossils of these remarkable animals come from the red rocks of Devon. Some lobefins are still around today, such as the famous \"living fossil\" fish, the coelacanth. A fossil creature from the Devonian discovered more recently has been hailed as a vital link between fish and the first vertebrates to walk on land. Found in the Canadian Arctic in 2004, Tiktaalik had a crocodile-like head and strong, bony fins that scientists think it used like legs to move in shallow waters or even on land. The fish showed other characteristics of terrestrial animals, including ribs, a neck, and nostrils on its snout for breathing air. The first amphibians breathed through simple lungs and their skin. They may have spent most of their lives in the water, leaving it only to escape the attentions of predatory fish. The first ammonoids also arose during the Devonian. Related to octopuses and squid, these marine animals survived until the end of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago. Plants began spreading beyond the wetlands during the Devonian, with new types developing that could survive on dry land. Toward the end of the Devonian the first forests arose as stemmed plants evolved strong, woody structures capable of supporting raised branches and leaves. Some Devonian trees are known to have grown 100 feet (30 meters) tall. By the end of the period the first ferns, horsetails, and seed plants had also appeared. The new life burgeoning on land apparently escaped the worst effects of the mass extinction that ended the Devonian. The main victims were marine creatures, with up to 70 percent of species wiped out. Reef-building communities almost completely disappeared. Theories put forward to explain this extinction include global cooling due to the re-glaciation of Gondwana, or reduced atmospheric levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide because of the foresting of the continents.

        "title": "Carboniferous Period",
        "text": "This time period took place 359 to 299 million years ago. The Carboniferous period, part of the late Paleozoic era, takes its name from large underground coal deposits that date to it. Formed from prehistoric vegetation, the majority of these deposits are found in parts of Europe, North America, and Asia that were lush, tropically located regions during the Carboniferous. In the U.S., scientists divide the Carboniferous into two parts: the earlier Mississipian (359.2 million to 318.1 million years ago) and the later Pennsylvanian (318.1 million to 299 million years ago). During the Mississipian, Euramerica, or Laurussia, which included North America, northern Europe, and Greenland, remained separate from the larger, cooler supercontinent of Gondwana to the south. To the east, parts of Asia, including China, were surrounded by warm oceans. While Gondwana became progressively colder as it began another poleward migration, the tropical landmasses remained wet and humid. Carboniferous coal was produced by bark-bearing trees that grew in vast lowland swamp forests. Vegetation included giant club mosses, tree ferns, great horsetails, and towering trees with strap-shaped leaves. Over millions of years, the organic deposits of this plant debris formed the world's first extensive coal deposits\u2014coal that humans are still burning today. The growth of these forests removed huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, leading to a surplus of oxygen. Atmospheric oxygen levels peaked around 35 percent, compared with 21 percent today. It also may explain the giant creepy-crawlies that now emerged\u2014the size reached by insects and similar creatures is thought to be limited by the amount of air they are able to breathe. Deadly poisonous centipedes some six feet (two meters) in length crawled in the company of mammoth cockroaches and scorpions as much as three feet (one meter) long. Most impressive of all were dragonflies that grew to the size of seagulls. One exquisitely detailed fossil of a dragonfly that died 320 million years ago shows it had a wingspan of 2.5 feet (0.75 meters). How insects first became airborne remains a mystery. Theories suggest their wings may have developed from structures used to regulate temperature (such as by catching the sun's rays to heat up), or perhaps they evolved from brightly colored signals used to attract mates and ward off rivals. Another idea is that insect wings developed from appendages used to glide between trees in the Carboniferous forests. Amphibians were also growing in size and diversity. There were predatory species that resembled modern-day crocodiles. Armed with vicious teeth, they reached lengths of almost 20 feet (6 meters). Some amphibians developed a thicker, scaly skin, solving the problem of them drying out if away from water too long. They also reduced their reliance on wetland habitats through a crucial evolutionary adaptation known as the amniote egg. This protected the embryo inside with a fluid-retaining membrane while still allowing in air. In time, the earliest reptiles appeared. Identified from remains found inside fossilized Carboniferous tree stumps, they were small, agile, lizard-like animals. Africa collided with eastern North America in the late Pennsylvanian, an event that formed the Appalachian Mountains.

        "title": "Planet Earth, explained",
        "text": "Our home planet provides us with life and protects us from space. Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word \u201cearth,\u201d which means simply \u201cthe ground.\u201d Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. Since our calendar years have only 365 days, we add an extra leap day every four years to account for the difference. Though we can't feel it, Earth zooms through its orbit at an average velocity of 18.5 miles a second. During this circuit, our planet is an average of 93 million miles away from the sun, a distance that takes light about eight minutes to traverse. Astronomers define this distance as one astronomical unit (AU), a measure that serves as a handy cosmic yardstick. Earth rotates on its axis every 23.9 hours, defining day and night for surface dwellers. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees away from the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, giving us seasons. Whichever hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun experiences summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets winter. In the spring and fall, each hemisphere receives similar amounts of light. On two specific dates each year\u2014called the equinoxes\u2014both hemispheres get illuminated equally. About 4.5 billion years ago, gravity coaxed Earth to form from the gaseous, dusty disk that surrounded our young sun. Over time, Earth's interior\u2014which is made mostly of silicate rocks and metals\u2014differentiated into four layers. Ages 7-12 At the planet's heart lies the inner core, a solid sphere of iron and nickel that's 759 miles wide and as hot as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The inner core is surrounded by the outer core, a 1,400-mile-thick band of iron and nickel fluids. Beyond the outer core lies the mantle, a 1,800-mile-thick layer of viscous molten rock on which Earth's outermost layer, the crust, rests. On land, the continental crust is an average of 19 miles thick, but the oceanic crust that forms the seafloor is thinner\u2014about three miles thick\u2014and denser. Like Venus and Mars, Earth has mountains, valleys, and volcanoes. But unlike its rocky siblings, almost 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered in oceans of liquid water that average 2.5 miles deep. These bodies of water contain 97 percent of Earth's volcanoes and the mid-ocean ridge, a massive mountain range more than 40,000 miles long. Earth's crust and upper mantle are divided into massive plates that grind against each other in slow motion. As these plates collide, tear apart, or slide past each other, they give rise to our very active geology. Earthquakes rumble as these plates snag and slip past each other. Many volcanoes form as seafloor crust smashes into and slides beneath continental crust. When plates of continental crust collide, mountain ranges such as the Himalaya are pushed toward the skies. Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and one percent other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and argon. Much like a greenhouse, this blanket of gases absorbs and retains heat. On average, Earth's surface temperature is about 57 degrees Fahrenheit; without our atmosphere, it'd be zero degrees. In the last two centuries, humans have added enough greenhouse gases to the atmosphere to raise Earth's average temperature by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This extra heat has altered Earth's weather patterns in many ways. The atmosphere not only nourishes life on Earth, but it also protects it: It's thick enough that many meteorites burn up before impact from friction, and its gases\u2014such as ozone\u2014block DNA-damaging ultraviolet light from reaching the surface. But for all that our atmosphere does, it's surprisingly thin. Ninety percent of Earth's atmosphere lies within just 10 miles of the planet's surface. The silhouette of a woman is seen on a Norwegian island beneath the Northern Lights (aurora borealis). We also enjoy protection from Earth's magnetic field, generated by our planet's rotation and its iron-nickel core. This teardrop-shaped field shields Earth from high-energy particles launched at us from the sun and elsewhere in the cosmos. But due to the field's structure, some particles get funneled to Earth's Poles and collide with our atmosphere, yielding aurorae, the natural fireworks show known by some as the northern lights. Earth is the planet we have the best opportunity to understand in detail\u2014helping us see how other rocky planets behave, even those orbiting distant stars. As a result, scientists are increasingly monitoring Earth from space. NASA alone has dozens of missions dedicated to solving our planet's mysteries. At the same time, telescopes are gazing outward to find other Earths. Thanks to instruments such as NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, astronomers have found more than 3,800 planets orbiting other stars, some of which are about the size of Earth, and a handful of which orbit in the zones around their stars that are just the right temperature to be potentially habitable.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nEarth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word \u201cearth,\u201d which means simply \u201cthe ground.\u201d \n\nEarth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. Since our calendar years have only 365 days, we add an extra leap day every four years to account for the difference. Though we can't feel it, Earth zooms through its orbit at an average velocity of 18.5 miles a second. During this circuit, our planet is an average of 93 million miles away from the sun, a distance that takes light about eight minutes to traverse. Astronomers define this distance as one astronomical unit (AU), a measure that serves as a handy cosmic yardstick. \n\nEarth rotates on its axis every 23.9 hours, defining day and night for surface dwellers. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees away from the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, giving us seasons. Whichever hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun experiences summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets winter. In the spring and fall, each hemisphere receives similar amounts of light. On two specific dates each year\u2014called the equinoxes\u2014both hemispheres get illuminated equally. \n\nAbout 4.5 billion years ago, gravity coaxed Earth to form from the gaseous, dusty disk that surrounded our young sun. Over time, Earth's interior\u2014which is made mostly of silicate rocks and metals\u2014differentiated into four layers. \n\nAt the planet's heart lies the inner core, a solid sphere of iron and nickel that's 759 miles wide and as hot as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The inner core is surrounded by the outer core, a 1,400-mile-thick band of iron and nickel fluids. Beyond the outer core lies the mantle, a 1,800-mile-thick layer of viscous molten rock on which Earth's outermost layer, the crust, rests. On land, the continental crust is an average of 19 miles thick, but the oceanic crust that forms the seafloor is thinner\u2014about three miles thick\u2014and denser. \n\nLike Venus and Mars, Earth has mountains, valleys, and volcanoes. But unlike its rocky siblings, almost 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered in oceans of liquid water that average 2.5 miles deep. These bodies of water contain 97 percent of Earth's volcanoes and the mid-ocean ridge, a massive mountain range more than 40,000 miles long. \n\nEarth's crust and upper mantle are divided into massive plates that grind against each other in slow motion. As these plates collide, tear apart, or slide past each other, they give rise to our very active geology. Earthquakes rumble as these plates snag and slip past each other. Many volcanoes form as seafloor crust smashes into and slides beneath continental crust. When plates of continental crust collide, mountain ranges such as the Himalaya are pushed toward the skies. \n\nEarth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and one percent other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and argon. Much like a greenhouse, this blanket of gases absorbs and retains heat. On average, Earth's surface temperature is about 57 degrees Fahrenheit; without our atmosphere, it'd be zero degrees. In the last two centuries, humans have added enough greenhouse gases to the atmosphere to raise Earth's average temperature by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This extra heat has altered Earth's weather patterns in many ways. \n\nThe atmosphere not only nourishes life on Earth, but it also protects it: It's thick enough that many meteorites burn up before impact from friction, and its gases\u2014such as ozone\u2014block DNA-damaging ultraviolet light from reaching the surface. But for all that our atmosphere does, it's surprisingly thin. Ninety percent of Earth's atmosphere lies within just 10 miles of the planet's surface. \n\nWe also enjoy protection from Earth's magnetic field, generated by our planet's rotation and its iron-nickel core. This teardrop-shaped field shields Earth from high-energy particles launched at us from the sun and elsewhere in the cosmos. But due to the field's structure, some particles get funneled to Earth's Poles and collide with our atmosphere, yielding aurorae, the natural fireworks show known by some as the northern lights. \n\nEarth is the planet we have the best opportunity to understand in detail\u2014helping us see how other rocky planets behave, even those orbiting distant stars. As a result, scientists are increasingly monitoring Earth from space. NASA alone has dozens of missions dedicated to solving our planet's mysteries. At the same time, telescopes are gazing outward to find other Earths. Thanks to instruments such as NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, astronomers have found more than 3,800 planets orbiting other stars, some of which are about the size of Earth, and a handful of which orbit in the zones around their stars that are just the right temperature to be potentially habitable. Other missions, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, are poised to find even more."

        "text": "A simulation of the dark matter distribution in the universe 13.6 billion years ago. Only five percent of the universe is visible. What is the rest made up of? The visible universe\u2014including Earth, the sun, other stars, and galaxies\u2014is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons bundled together into atoms. Perhaps one of the most surprising discoveries of the 20th century was that this ordinary, or baryonic, matter makes up less than 5 percent of the mass of the universe. The rest of the universe appears to be made of a mysterious, invisible substance called dark matter (25 percent) and a force that repels gravity known as dark energy (70 percent). Scientists have not yet observed dark matter directly. It doesn't interact with baryonic matter and it's completely invisible to light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making dark matter impossible to detect with current instruments. But scientists are confident it exists because of the gravitational effects it appears to have on galaxies and galaxy clusters. For instance, according to standard physics, stars at the edges of a spinning, spiral galaxy should travel much slower than those near the galactic center, where a galaxy's visible matter is concentrated. But observations show that stars orbit at more or less the same speed regardless of where they are in the galactic disk. This puzzling result makes sense if one assumes that the boundary stars are feeling the gravitational effects of an unseen mass\u2014dark matter\u2014in a halo around the galaxy. Dark matter could also explain certain optical illusions that astronomers see in the deep universe. For example, pictures of galaxies that include strange rings and arcs of light could be explained if the light from even more distant galaxies is being distorted and magnified by massive, invisible clouds of dark matter in the foreground-a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Scientists have a few ideas for what dark matter might be. One leading hypothesis is that dark matter consists of exotic particles that don't interact with normal matter or light but that still exert a gravitational pull. Several scientific groups, including one at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, are currently working to generate dark matter particles for study in the lab. Other scientists think the effects of dark matter could be explained by fundamentally modifying our theories of gravity. According to such ideas, there are multiple forms of gravity, and the large-scale gravity governing galaxies differs from the gravity to which we are accustomed. Dark energy is even more mysterious, and its discovery in the 1990s was a complete shock to scientists. Previously, physicists had assumed that the attractive force of gravity would slow down the expansion of the universe over time. But when two independent teams tried to measure the rate of deceleration, they found that the expansion was actually speeding up. One scientist likened the finding to throwing a set of keys up in the air expecting them to fall back down-only to see them fly straight up toward the ceiling. Scientists now think that the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by a kind of repulsive force generated by quantum fluctuations in otherwise \"empty\" space. What's more, the force seems to be growing stronger as the universe expands. For lack of a better name, scientists call this mysterious force dark energy. Unlike for dark matter, scientists have no plausible explanation for dark energy. According to one idea, dark energy is a fifth and previously unknown type of fundamental force called quintessence, which fills the universe like a fluid. Many scientists have also pointed out that the known properties of dark energy are consistent with a cosmological constant, a mathematical Band-Aid that Albert Einstein added to his theory of general relativity to make his equations fit with the notion of a static universe. According to Einstein, the constant would be a repulsive force that counteracts gravity, keeping the universe from collapsing in on itself. Einstein later discarded the idea when astronomical observations revealed that the universe was expanding, calling the cosmological constant his \"biggest blunder.\" Now that we see the expansion of the universe is accelerating, adding in dark energy as a cosmological constant could neatly explain how space-time is being stretched apart. But that explanation still leaves scientists clueless as to why the strange force exists in the first place.

        "text": "Seismic data like the lines pictured on this 3D map help scientists understand the structure of the earth's core. This particular map helps scientists at Chesapeake Energy\u2019s Oklahoma City headquarters choose the best spots to drill. Learn about the layers inside the Earth, inaccessible to humans. The Earth's interior is composed of four layers, three solid and one liquid\u2014not magma but molten metal, nearly as hot as the surface of the sun.  The deepest layer is a solid iron ball, about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) in diameter. Although this inner core is white hot, the pressure is so high the iron cannot melt.  The iron isn't pure\u2014scientists believe it contains sulfur and nickel, plus smaller amounts of other elements. Estimates of its temperature vary, but it is probably somewhere between 9,000 and 13,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,000 and 7,000 degrees Celsius).  Above the inner core is the outer core, a shell of liquid iron. This layer is cooler but still very hot, perhaps 7,200 to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,000 to 5,000 degrees Celsius). It too is composed mostly of iron, plus substantial amounts of sulfur and nickel. It creates the Earth's magnetic field and is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick. The next layer is the mantle. Many people think of this as lava, but it's actually rock. The rock is so hot, however, that it flows under pressure, like road tar. This creates very slow-moving currents as hot rock rises from the depths and cooler rock descends. The mantle is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and appears to be divided into two layers: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The boundary between the two lies about 465 miles (750 kilometers) beneath the Earth's surface. The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth. It is the familiar landscape on which we live: rocks, soil, and seabed. It ranges from about five miles (eight kilometers) thick beneath the oceans to an average of 25 miles (40 kilometers) thick beneath the continents. Currents within the mantle have broken the crust into blocks, called plates, which slowly move around, colliding to build mountains or rifting apart to form new seafloor. Continents are composed of relatively light blocks that float high on the mantle, like gigantic, slow-moving icebergs. Seafloor is made of a denser rock called basalt, which presses deeper into the mantle, producing basins that can fill with water. Except in the crust, the interior of the Earth cannot be studied by drilling holes to take samples. Instead, scientists map the interior by watching how seismic waves from earthquakes are bent, reflected, sped up, or delayed by the various layers.

        "title": "Here's the real reason the U.S. doesn't use the metric system",
        "text": "The United States is one of just three countries that \"prefers\" imperial measurements over the international metric standard. The motivation why has less to do with official policy than you might think. What do Libya, Myanmar, and the United States have in common? Proponents of the metric system claim all three nations have a shameful similarity: They use imperial measurements\u2014feet, pounds, and miles\u2014instead of meters, grams, and kilometers. \u00a0 The truth, however, is more complicated: Though imperial units are commonly used in the U.S., the metric system is actually the nation\u2019s preferred system of measurement. So why don\u2019t Americans use it? Here\u2019s how the metric system evolved\u2014and why it\u2019s still struggling to gain a foothold in daily life. First, the facts: \u201cIt\u2019s been legal to use the metric system in the United States since 1866,\u201d says Elizabeth Benham, \u00a0program leader of the federal metric program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal agency in charge of standard weights and measures. In fact, government policy since the 1970s has designated the metric system\u2014also known as SI, or the International System of Units\u2014the nation\u2019s preferred system of measurement for trade and commerce. But since the U.S. has adopted a voluntary approach, nudging industries and individuals toward using SI instead of making its use a blanket policy, adoption is turning out to be a multi-century endeavor. The challenge is reflected in the measurement system\u2019s often chaotic history\u2014and its origins in the French Revolution. In the late 18th century, Enlightenment-era Frenchmen saw a tantalizing opportunity in the political upheaval that gripped their nation. Up until then, France had been home to a dizzying array of weights and measures, with up to 250,000 units of measurement in use in France alone, and other nations and even regions within nations had their own ways of quantifying the world around them. This was a measurable nightmare for scientists, who dreamed of an international standard based on some universal, unchanging constant. Ages 7-12 Tasked with determining a new system, the French Academy of Sciences decided that the measurement underpinning it should consist of the length of one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator as measured from Paris, France. That measure\u2014known as a meter and painstakingly documented by a group of scientific luminaries\u2014became the basis of all metric units of weight and measurement that followed. Even measures of volume were based on the meter\u2014a milliliter, for example, is the volume of a cubic centimeter of water. The new system was readily adopted by the French state, but the public has always proven much slower to follow suit. Implementation lagged, even as the new system electrified scientists worldwide, using the meter to help define things like electricity and magnetism. And the concept began to spread: By 1866, the idea was adopted by the U.S., which passed a law that year allowing the use of metric measurements in commerce. Slowly, the metric system spread throughout the nation, first thanks to brass standards issued to the states to help them standardize their weights and measurements, then thanks to the Treaty of the Meter, an 1875 agreement signed by the U.S. and other powerful nations like Germany, Russia, and France. This treaty created an international governing body for weights and measures, paving the way for the U.S. to make the switch on a wider scale. But American adoption still lagged, even as scientists kept improving the system and applying it to more and more fields of inquiry. By 1960, the metric system had been expanded and modernized to cover aspects of all of Earth, from voltage to speed, heat capacity to radiance. That year, the International System of Units, or SI, was defined and adopted worldwide. Most other nations dutifully adopted SI, changing road signs and packaging and teaching the metric system in schools. Even the United Kingdom, which had lagged for years, mostly embraced the system in an effort to keep pace with other European Union nations. (Since the U.K. left the EU, metric opponents there have argued the nation should stop using metric units, a controversial proposition that has yet to be adopted.) Despite international adoption and increasing federal policy encouraging the use of metric units, the U.S. continued to drag its feet. Resistance was fueled in part by industrialists who argued the system was too complicated and expensive to implement, legislators suspicious of \u201cforeign\u201d influence, and controversies over whether wide-scale federal adoption might infringe on states\u2019 rights. The end result was confusion. Though the U.S. officially declared SI the nation\u2019s preferred system through the 1975 Metric Conversion Act, even federal agencies were slow to adopt metric in industry, education, commerce, and daily life. One example is road signs: Though federal officials attempted to turn a new interstate in Arizona into an SI poster child in the wake of the Metric Conversion Act, even giving it kilometer markers instead of mileposts, transportation officials never extended metric-only signage to the remainder of the federal highway system. Instead, says Benham, both systems are still widely used nationwide. \u201cWe\u2019re working in a risky hybrid measurement environment,\u201d she notes. Dual labels are common, and often metric measurements hide in plain sight on rulers, road signs, and tools. This can lead to costly miscalculations and public confusion. \u201cLarge organizations that had the resources and technical staff to facilitate [metric] saw right away that it would give them a strategic advantage,\u201d Benham explains. \u201cThey adopted best practices and moved on.\u201d But smaller businesses and individuals need help making the switch, as do educators poised to inform future generations of metric-native learners. Nonetheless, Benham still believes voluntary metrification in the U.S. is possible\u2014and encourages individuals to look for the metric measurements that already surround them. \u201cI use the analogy of an iceberg,\u201d she says. On the surface are U.S. imperial units, but many industries already use metric measurements, including food labels, car speedometers, and thermometers. Ultimately, says Benham, a full transition to the metric system won\u2019t be possible until individuals take the plunge and decide to use it in their daily lives. That\u2019s why she focuses on education at her job\u2014and has switched to the metric system in her daily life, setting her smartphone to measure length in kilometers instead of miles and using degrees Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. \u201cWe have the technology,\u201d she says. \u201cChange is going to happen. It\u2019s just a slower change than a mandatory approach.\u201d Are you ready to change? If so, Benham recommends a glimpse at NIST\u2019s online tools, which include tips on incorporating metric measurements into everything from cooking to gardening and health. \u201cOnce you overcome the hurdle of learning more units, it\u2019s easy,\u201d she explains. And widespread metrification could be easy too\u2014if the American public only had the will. \u00a0 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

a strategic advantage,\u201d Benham explains. \n\n\u201cThey adopted best practices and moved on.\u201d \n\nBut smaller businesses and individuals need help making the switch, as do educators poised to inform future generations of metric-native learners. \n\nNonetheless, Benham still believes voluntary metrification in the U.S. is possible\u2014and encourages individuals to look for the metric measurements that already surround them. \n\n\u201cI use the analogy of an iceberg,\u201d she says. \n\nOn the surface are U.S. imperial units, but many industries already use metric measurements, including food labels, car speedometers, and thermometers. \n\nUltimately, says Benham, a full transition to the metric system won\u2019t be possible until individuals take the plunge and decide to use it in their daily lives. \n\nThat\u2019s why she focuses on education at her job\u2014and has switched to the metric system in her daily life, setting her smartphone to measure length in kilometers instead of miles and using degrees Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. \n\n\u201cWe have the technology,\u201d she says. \n\n\u201cChange is going to happen. It\u2019s just a slower change than a mandatory approach.\u201d \n\nAre you ready to change? \n\nIf so, Benham recommends a glimpse at NIST\u2019s online tools, which include tips on incorporating metric measurements into everything from cooking to gardening and health. \n\n\u201cOnce you overcome the hurdle of learning more units, it\u2019s easy,\u201d she explains. \n\nAnd widespread metrification could be easy too\u2014if the American public only had the will."

The Jonestown massacre remains one of the largest mass murders in American history. In a single day, 901 Americans and 8 Guyanese died from Jim Jones\u2019 actions. Met with criticism rather than compassion, victims and survivors of the 1978 tragedy were often blamed and seen as \u201ccrazy\u201d for joining the movement.\u00a0 The truth is that Jonestown\u2019s leader, preacher Jim Jones, was successful in drawing in followers in the United States because his message resonated in an era of frustration and upheaval\u2014and his views were legitimized by other civil rights leaders. In Guyana, Jones offered a utopia where followers could enact their vision of an equal, self-sufficient society.\u00a0 (Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown will premiere June 17 on Hulu and August 14 on National Geographic.) \u00a0Wildly charismatic, Jones preached what so many Americans longed to hear. Young radicals, disillusioned by establishment politics and the Vietnam War, applauded the socialist principles he promoted at his church, Peoples Temple. Black members were also drawn in, at one point making up 80 to 90 percent of the congregation. Not only did much of Jones\u2019 work take on civil rights issues, he also modeled traditional Black worship styles, touted his adopted Black and Korean children, and even claimed he himself was Black.

Moore estimated that Jonestown\u2019s largest demographic group were Black women and girls, who made up 45 percent of the population. Black members made up 68 percent of Jonestown\u2019s total population. The commune was also predominately youthful, with 63 percent of the population 35 or younger, and 152 children under the age of 12. Everyone played a role.

        "title": "The man who died searching for the Lost City of Z",
        "text": "In 1925, explorer and surveyor Percy Fawcett disappeared in the Amazon basin looking for an ancient civilization. Although he was inspired by questionable sources, we now know if his search was in vain. When the Spanish first ventured into the Amazon Basin in the 1540s, they recorded Indigenous accounts of a lost city of fantastic wealth that they called El Dorado (\u201cthe golden\u201d). Over the centuries, many vain attempts were made to locate a lost civilization in the Amazon rainforest. The last significant attempt to find such a culture was undertaken by British explorer Percy Fawcett. Between 1906 and 1924, Fawcett made seven expeditions across the Amazon Basin, concluding with his doomed quest to find the city he called Z. Fawcett was inspired by his extensive reading of historical sources, including a mysterious document known as Manuscript 512. A man of extraordinary mental and physical stamina, Fawcett was working at a time when the Amazon region was still largely undocumented by Europeans who sought to explore its jungles and waterways, seeking ancient cities and riches. His disappearance during his search for Z in 1925, in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, continues to intrigue writers and filmmakers. (The true story of the 'lost city' made famous by Indiana Jones.) Percy Harrison Fawcett was born in 1867 in Torquay, Devon, the English county that had produced many famous explorers and mariners, including Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh. The son of an aristocrat who had lost his fortune, Fawcett described his childhood as lacking in affection. At age 19, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery and sent to outposts of the British Empire. In 1901, Fawcett joined the Royal Geographical Society of London and traveled to Africa as a surveyor in the service of the British state, tasked with gathering military intelligence. In 1906, he was commissioned by the society to lead an expedition to the Amazon. Ages 7-12 Arriving in South America was the moment his whole life changed. Setting out from La Paz to map the vast territory on the borderlands of Bolivia and Brazil, Fawcett often faced hostility from Indigenous peoples angered by rubber barons, who had invaded their lands to extract rubber for use in car and train manufacturing. For nearly a decade he roamed the Amazon Basin, often the first European to record geographical features such as waterfalls. His writing gives a sense of the awe he experienced: Above us rose the Ricardo Franco hills, flat topped and mysterious, their flanks scarred by deep quebradas [ravines]. They stood like a lost world, forested to their tops, and the imagination could picture the last vestiges of an age long vanished. The outbreak of World War I interrupted this rich period of exploration, forcing him to return to Europe. Although in his 50s, Fawcett was in peak physical condition, and he proved to be an outstanding soldier. (These other explorers disappeared into thin air. Will we ever know the truth?) Fawcett could not shake off the allure of South America, however. So, when the war ended, he returned to Brazil, where he would pursue an idea that led him to his last great adventures and, ultimately, his mysterious death. Although Fawcett often relied on racist tropes and ideas when he wrote of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous peoples, he also made great efforts to understand their customs and languages. He lamented the effects of colonialist greed on these societies and became convinced that Spanish and Portuguese accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries of complex civilizations in the rainforest may have had merit. Such accounts mention \u201cvery large settlements\u201d as well as \u201cfine roadways in the interior.\u201d One document in particular fascinated Fawcett. Known as Manuscript 512 and written in Portuguese, it is purportedly an account by adventurers and fortune hunters. In 1753, in search of precious metals, the adventurers found a ruined city boasting monumental buildings, roads, and a plaza, in \u201ceach corner of which is a spire, in the style of the Romans.\u201d Scholars are divided about the manuscript\u2019s authenticity. Skeptics consider it a forgery. Brazil achieved independence from Portugal in 1825. It would have been useful for a new, insecure republic to \u201cdiscover\u201d a document that described ancient civilizations in its territory\u2014akin to the great Maya sites in Central America. Many at the time, however, accepted the manuscript\u2019s authenticity, including Fawcett, already convinced that early accounts of complex civilizations in the rainforest were accurate. He became obsessed with finding such a place. Although Fawcett was inspired by Manuscript 512\u2019s claims, he never intended to find the city it described. The settlement in that document lies, supposedly, in Brazil\u2019s northeast. Citing other sources (which he did not name), Fawcett became convinced that a lost civilization existed in the wild, central-western region of Mato Grosso. He named the city Z. In April 1925, Fawcett set out from Cuiaba\u0301 to find it, accompanied by his eldest son, Jack, and his son\u2019s best friend, Raleigh Rimell. The last news from them was in a letter Fawcett sent to his wife: \u201cWe shall disappear from civilization until next year. Imagine us ... in forests so far untrodden by civilised man.\u201d And then they really did disappear. Were they killed by animals or people? Several expeditions were launched in an attempt to clarify what happened, including one headed by Peter Fleming, brother of the James Bond creator Ian Fleming. Many of these ventures also ended in tragedy. And none shed any light on what happened to Fawcett. (This Arctic murder mystery remains unsolved after 150 years.) In 1952, anthropologist Orlando Villas-Bo\u0302as announced he had found the bones of the explorer and that Kalapalo Indians had confessed to killing him. Later forensic analysis showed the remains did not belong to Fawcett. Fawcett\u2019s story has had an enduring cultural impact. He is one of the inspirations for the character Indiana Jones. (The Walt Disney Company is a majority owner of National Geographic Media.) The English explorer was also the subject of David Grann\u2019s The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, the basis for a 2016 feature film. In his book, Grann quotes Kalapalo Indians, who insist they had not killed Fawcett. They had seen the smoke from Fawcett\u2019s camp for a few days until it stopped. They say he likely died at the hands of \u201chostile\u201d people in territory to the east. (Did Indiana Jones help or hurt archaeology?) Although the mystery of his last days may never be fully resolved, Fawcett\u2019s quest for a lost city may be at an end. In the decades since his disappearance, exploration of northeastern Mato Grosso has uncovered the remains of large urban settlements, now located in Xingu Indigenous Park. Named Kuhikugu, the complex includes remnants of streets, bridges, and large squares. Modern lidar scans further suggest that between 1,500 and 400 years ago, this part of the Amazon was indeed the site of a large settlement. While Z\u2019s exact identity and location are still a mystery, Fawcett\u2019s hunch about a hidden ancient city in the region seems to have been correct.

In 1877, her great-grandmother Emma Johnson and other ancestors moved from Georgetown and Lexington, Kentucky, to establish one of the first all-Black towns west of the Mississippi River. Her family\u2019s move to Kansas was a precursor to the Great Exodus, the first voluntary mass migration of African Americans from the South to what we now call the Midwest, including Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.\u00a0 After the Civil War, tens of thousands of newly freed Black families fled the South after several regional states passed oppressive \u201cBlack Codes\u201d with the intent to restrict the freedom and rights of African Americans.\u00a0 \u201cIt was the first major instance of African Americans\u2026\u2018voting with their feet,\u2019 demonstrating their discontent with the South,\u201d says Damani Davis, reference archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\u00a0 In a way, the Great Exodus and Nicodemus helped rewrite Black history in America. Nestled in the expansive Kansas prairie, Nicodemus\u2019 legacy reminds us of a pivotal chapter in American history and the enduring spirit of those who sought freedom and opportunity against formidable odds. When President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops from the South in 1877, the region quickly reversed many of the economic and political gains African Americans had achieved during the 12-year Reconstruction period. The Ku Klux Klan rose to power, using lynchings and mob violence to terrorize Black communities. Southern states enacted Black Codes, local laws intended to disenfranchise African Americans and force them into exploitative labor systems like sharecropping. According to Davis, these despotic rules laid the groundwork for the more formalized Jim Crow laws that followed. (Here\u2019s how the Harlem Renaissance helped forge a new sense of Black identity.) Faced with increasing violence and oppression, Black Americans began to look for new lands where they could find safety and autonomy. Southern conventions, where African Americans discussed politics and social concerns, sparked stories of a \u201cpromised land.\u201d The idea of owning and farming land independently in a free state was especially appealing compared to the harsh realities of sharecropping in the South. This vision was reminiscent of the biblical exodus, leading to the migrants being called \u201cExodusters.\u201d The Homestead Act of 1862 fueled some of the excitement over reaching Kansas. This law allowed adults to claim 160 acres of land at a low cost if they moved to Kansas and other parts of the Midwest and worked the land for at least five years. Kansas\u2019 proximity to the South made it more accessible than more distant western territories, though the journey was still out of reach for many Black Americans. \u201cFar more people attempted to go to Kansas than actually succeeded,\u201d says Davis.

The committee interviewed over 150 people, including Benjamin \u201cPap\u201d Singleton, a former enslaved person who had escaped from Tennessee to Canada and returned after the Civil War.\u00a0 In his testimony to the Senate, Singleton said his community didn\u2019t want to leave the South but that Black Americans needed to go to teach the South a lesson. In 1873, Singleton led 300 African Americans from southern states to the southeastern corner of Kansas, to a new home he called Singleton Colony. A few years later, he helped establish the town of Nicodemus, Kansas, for fellow Exodusters. (These African American history museums amplify the voices left unheard.) The Great Exodus peaked in the spring of 1879 when about 6,000 African Americans left Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas on trains and steamboats heading to St. Louis, the halfway point in the Exoduster journey, before crossing Missouri to settle in areas in Topeka and Atchison.

        "title": "How did the Maya choose sacrifice victims? DNA yields new clues.",
        "text": "A study of human remains deposited over 800 years at the Maya city of Chichen Itza challenges long-held assumptions about the age and gender of sacrifice victims. Almost 60 years ago, archaeologists discovered a cache of human bones in an underground cistern in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, one of the most powerful cities of the ancient Maya. The cistern was connected to a cave located only a couple hundred feet from the Sacred Cenote, a water-filled sinkhole filled with the remains of hundreds of human sacrifices. \u00a0When the discovery in the cistern, or chult\u00fan, was made on Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in 1967, archaeologists determined that young adults and children had been deposited there over a span of eight centuries and assumed that most of them were and young women; at the time, it was thought that the Maya preferred female victims for their ritual sacrifices. But now a new DNA study has turned that assumption on its head, by revealing that all of the 64 sets of human remains sampled from the cave are from male victims, many of them brothers and cousins between the ages of three and six years old\u2014and an unlikely number of identical twins. \u201cWe were not expecting this to be the case,\u201d says archaeogeneticist Rodrigo Barquera of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and the lead author of a new study describing the analysis just published in the journal Nature. \u201cTraditionally, these kinds of burials are associated in Mesoamerican archaeology with fertility offerings, and fertility offerings usually feature females only.\u201d \u00a0In recent years, Barquera and his co-authors have taken another look at the bones recovered from the chult\u00fan and cave in 1967, which are now stored nearby. Their new analysis suggests that the location was used for more than 100 burials between A.D. 500 and the 1300s. Ages 7-12 \u00a0Most of the people buried there were interred before the 900s\u2014roughly when Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was the dominant city of the northern Maya lowlands, which covered what are now Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, northern Guatemala, and Belize. Earlier anthropological studies had revealed that the victims were mostly toddlers and young children; but this is the first time that their DNA has been analyzed, Barquera says. As well as learning that only boys had been buried in the cave, the researchers were surprised to find that many had been closely related: At least a quarter were a brother or cousin to another boy buried in the same cave, and the burials included two pairs of identical twins.\u00a0 Identical twins occur only in about 0.4 percent of births, so finding two pairs of such twins among 64 burials is much higher than would be expected by chance, Barquera notes. It\u2019s not clear how widespread human sacrifice was among the Maya, although there are many Spanish reports of practice after they arrived in the Maya territories in the early 16th century. It now seems the Maya mainly practiced human sacrifice in the later stages of their civilization, to seek favor from their gods for the fertility of their crops, or for rain, or for victory in war. Twins feature prominently in Mesoamerican mythology and are a central theme in the Popul Vuh, a sacred narrative of the K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya people thought to date from the earliest stages of Maya civilization. According to the Popul Vuh, twins named Hun-Hunahp\u00fa and Vucub-Hanahp\u00fa descended into the underworld to play a ball game, but were sacrificed by the gods after they were defeated. Despite his death, the head of one of the twins impregnated a maiden with the \u201cHero twins\u201d Hunahp\u00fa and Xbalanqu\u00e9, who went on to avenge their father through repeated cycles of sacrifice and resurrection. Barquera notes that subterranean structures, such as the cave where the children were buried, were seen as entrances to the underworld; and it could be that the sacrifices of boy twins and close relatives\u2014perhaps when true twins were not available\u2014were part of rituals involving the Hero twins that were intended to ensure bountiful harvests of maize. The new Nature study raises additional questions for archaeologists to answer. The first is the causes of death, since there are no visible human-made marks on the bones from the cave, unlike remains from the nearby Sacred Cenote. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any cut marks or any lesions that would point to specific methods of sacrifice,\u201d Barquera says. \u201cThis indicates that the sacrifice did not involve, for example, heart extraction or decapitation\u2014so maybe it was a different kind of sacrificial method.\u201d Further ancient DNA analysis could establish whether any of the children buried in the cave were from multiple generations of the same family, which may indicate that the honor\u2014or curse\u2014of providing sacrificial victims may have been an inherited privilege among certain families, Barquera says. The new analysis also involved analyzing blood samples from modern Maya who live near Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 today; the results show a \u201cgenetic continuity\u201d between the children buried in the cave and the modern people of the region. Barquera says this indicates that the sacrificial victims came from the local population and not more distant communities across the Maya empire. The researchers also saw distinctive differences between ancient and modern DNA sequences involving immunities to diseases, suggesting that the local Maya have adapted to certain infectious diseases, such as Salmonella enterica, introduced during the Spanish Colonial period, Barquera says. Archaeologist and National Geographic explorer Guillermo de Anda, a researcher with Mexico\u2019s National Institution of Archaeology and History, wasn\u2019t involved in the latest study but has spent decades researching human sacrifices at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, including numerous dives into the Sacred Cenote. He recently went looking in the nearby jungle for the cave where the mass burial was discovered in 1967, but it seems to have been covered by what\u2019s left of an airstrip built a few years later\u2014but then abandoned\u2014near the vast city ruins. \u00a0\u201cWe would really love it to be there, but it looks like it\u2019s gone forever,\u201d de Anda says. De Anda says that the proximity of the cave to the Sacred Cenote raises questions about why two different places so close to each other were both used to dispose of sacrificial victims; and the lack of visible causes of death on the bones from the cave burials is also a mystery that needs to be addressed. This seems to be the first time that ancient DNA analysis has been used on any remains from Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, and De Anda hopes such techniques will now be used on the bones of sacrificial victims from the Sacred Cenote. \u201cThis is a new thing for Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are looking forward to doing it.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "The 'Hello Girls' helped win WWI\u2014why was their service overlooked?",
        "text": "When American women were first deployed into combat zones, the U.S. refused to consider them veterans for more than 50 years. Ethel Elkins was one roughly 25,000 American women who volunteered in Europe during the First World War. But unlike most who served with the International Red Cross and other aid organizations, Elkins was one of the first female soldiers officially deployed to a combat zone\u2014as a uniformed member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. An eager nation took note: \u201cHow many girls do you know with \u2018the disposition of angels\u2019 who can add thereto a strong constitution, soldierly fortitude, a low, musical voice, and ability to speak French just as fluently as English?\u201d trilled a reporter in a 1918 Philadelphia newspaper article about Elkins. She was no girl, but her voice did matter: Her unit would serve as front-line telephone operators on the battlefields of France, translating, encoding, and deciphering critical messages between French and U.S. forces. Known informally as the \u201cHello Girls,\u201d the 223 women of the Woman\u2019s Telephone Unit of the American Signal Corps were known for their efficacy, patience, and fearlessness on the battlefront. But despite their historic service and the significant publicity they elicited at the beginning of their military service, Elkins and her counterparts would later be denied veteran status and military benefits, and their efforts almost completely forgotten. No longer: More than a century later, a bipartisan group of legislators is pushing for Congress to memorialize the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit\u2019s service with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor: the Congressional Gold Medal. When the U.S. first entered the war in 1917, it had tried relying on French telephone operators to place calls to and from the front, but issues with English proficiency and cultural differences prompted American officials to turn to their own servicemen to do the job. That failed, too: The male soldiers\u2019 lack of language proficiency and experience with switchboards immediately became clear. The Army needed experienced operators, and most American telephone operators at the time were women. So that same year, General John Pershing put out a call for women interested in serving their country at the front. Soon, the Army gathered a group of mostly bilingual operators, culled from single applicants who could passed psychological tests and Secret Service background checks. Subject to regular Army discipline, the women, who were an average age of 26, underwent military training including drills and lessons on military history and terminology. The first group of 33 telephone operators, wearing U.S. Army uniforms of navy blue wool, reported to the front in France in March 1918.  Ages 7-12 The presence of American women on European battlefields made a splash from the start, and they immediately became known as the \u201cHello Girls,\u201d a term with unknown origins that emerged with the growing popularity of the telephone in the early 20th century. They operated at five times the speed of their male counterparts, says Lora Vogt, Vice President of Education and Interpretation at the National WWI Museum and Memorial, and maintained and provided the communications essential to Allied victory. The job was dangerous, historian Jill Frahm writes: The women often worked within range of German artillery, performing everything from transmitting coded messages to directing supplies to connecting commanding officers with men in the trenches, even working to get communications working when the fighting damaged wires. \u201cThe [Army Expeditionary Forces] telephone operators were a trusted part of the military machine,\u201d writes Frahm, \u201csomething no group of women had ever been before.\u201d  That doesn\u2019t mean their service was easy\u2014or that they were sheltered from casual misogyny on the front. As historian Elizabeth Cobbs documents in her book The Hello Girls: America\u2019s First Women Soldiers, many women felt their efforts were hampered because they were stationed too far from the front, while others dealt with obvious opposition to their presence in the field from many commanding officers. In 1918, the female soldiers formally protested the nickname \u201cHello Girls,\u201d resulting in a War Department directive to respectfully call them the Woman\u2019s Telephone Unit of the American Signal Corps instead. Though the hundreds of American female telephone operators served in France through 1920, just one of them was decorated by the Signal Corps. As Cobbs notes, most even didn\u2019t realize the U.S. government didn\u2019t see them as soldiers until they attempted to apply for the same types of benefits offered to male military members and veterans, including combat bonuses, pensions, and military funerals. They weren\u2019t even reimbursed for their uniforms, which the Army had made them purchase with their own money. \u00a0 Only in 1977, after a lawsuit and legislation, the women granted veteran status\u2014over the objections of the Army, the Veterans\u2019 Administration, and even the American Legion. Today, supporters of the Hello Girls say that the efforts of 1977 didn\u2019t go far enough. In their proposed legislation, re-introduced in May 2024, the bipartisan group from the House and Senate call for the women to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Endorsed by the American Historical Society, the American Legion, and others, the law, if passed, would officially recognize the women\u2019s service during what co-sponsor Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II calls \u201ca time of grave uncertainty.\u201d The move may be seen as too little, too late by some, but Vogt says it would highlight the importance of the story not just within classrooms or in history books, but in the national conversation. These American women \u201cwere crucial in the Allied victory of World War I,\u201d she says. \u201cTo receive this posthumous honor will help recognize the not equal\u2014but superior\u2014work the women within the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit contributed to the war effort.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

But despite their historic service and the significant publicity they elicited at the beginning of their military service, Elkins and her counterparts would later be denied veteran status and military benefits, and their efforts almost completely forgotten.\n\nWhen the U.S. first entered the war in 1917, it had tried relying on French telephone operators to place calls to and from the front, but issues with English proficiency and cultural differences prompted American officials to turn to their own servicemen to do the job. That failed, too: The male soldiers\u2019 lack of language proficiency and experience with switchboards immediately became clear. The Army needed experienced operators, and most American telephone operators at the time were women. So that same year, General John Pershing put out a call for women interested in serving their country at the front.\n\nSoon, the Army gathered a group of mostly bilingual operators, culled from single applicants who could passed psychological tests and Secret Service background checks. Subject to regular Army discipline, the women, who were an average age of 26, underwent military training including drills and lessons on military history and terminology. The first group of 33 telephone operators, wearing U.S. Army uniforms of navy blue wool, reported to the front in France in March 1918.\n\nThe presence of American women on European battlefields made a splash from the start, and they immediately became known as the \u201cHello Girls,\u201d a term with unknown origins that emerged with the growing popularity of the telephone in the early 20th century. They operated at five times the speed of their male counterparts, says Lora Vogt, Vice President of Education and Interpretation at the National WWI Museum and Memorial, and maintained and provided the communications essential to Allied victory.\n\nThe job was dangerous, historian Jill Frahm writes: The women often worked within range of German artillery, performing everything from transmitting coded messages to directing supplies to connecting commanding officers with men in the trenches, even working to get communications working when the fighting damaged wires. \u201cThe [Army Expeditionary Forces] telephone operators were a trusted part of the military machine,\u201d writes Frahm, \u201csomething no group of women had ever been before.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean their service was easy\u2014or that they were sheltered from casual misogyny on the front. As historian Elizabeth Cobbs documents in her book The Hello Girls: America\u2019s First Women Soldiers, many women felt their efforts were hampered because they were stationed too far from the front, while others dealt with obvious opposition to their presence in the field from many commanding officers.\n\nIn 1918, the female soldiers formally protested the nickname \u201cHello Girls,\u201d resulting in a War Department directive to respectfully call them the Woman\u2019s Telephone Unit of the American Signal Corps instead. Though the hundreds of American female telephone operators served in France through 1920, just one of them was decorated by the Signal Corps. As Cobbs notes, most even didn\u2019t realize the U.S. government didn\u2019t see them as soldiers until they attempted to apply for the same types of benefits offered to male military members and veterans, including combat bonuses, pensions, and military funerals. They weren\u2019t even reimbursed for their uniforms, which the Army had made them purchase with their own money.\n\nOnly in 1977, after a lawsuit and legislation, the women granted veteran status\u2014over the objections of the Army, the Veterans\u2019 Administration, and even the American Legion. Today, supporters of the Hello Girls say that the efforts of 1977 didn\u2019t go far enough. In their proposed legislation, re-introduced in May 2024, the bipartisan group from the House and Senate call for the women to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\nEndorsed by the American Historical Society, the American Legion, and others, the law, if passed, would officially recognize the women\u2019s service during what co-sponsor Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II calls \u201ca time of grave uncertainty.\u201d The move may be seen as too little, too late by some, but Vogt says it would highlight the importance of the story not just within classrooms or in history books, but in the national conversation. These American women \u201cwere crucial in the Allied victory of World War I,\u201d she says. \u201cTo receive this posthumous honor will help recognize the not equal\u2014but superior\u2014work the women within the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit contributed to the war effort.\u201d"

        "text": "Some of the first people to touch down in Guyana in November 1978 remember what they saw at the scene where over 900 people died. By November 1978, U.S. Air Force Special Operations sergeant David Netterville had served for nearly seven years and had completed a tour in Vietnam. But nothing could\u2019ve prepared him for what he saw in Jonestown, a commune led by Jim Jones in the forests of Guyana. \u201cIt was unprecedented,\u201d says Netterville, who gave his first ever broadcast\u00a0interview for the National Geographic docuseries Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown. \u201cI was just totally shocked at the number of bodies that were laying on the ground.\u201d (Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown will premiere June 17 on Hulu and August 14 on National Geographic) The victims had been members of Peoples Temple, a religious movement Jones founded in the United States. In the 1970s, Jones had led them from California to Guyana, where they built Jonestown. Jones promised it would become a utopia. Instead, Jones gave them death.\u00a0 Arriving at Jonestown\u00a0on November\u00a020,\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reporter Charles Krause did not immediately register the mass of colors on the ground below as an unfathomable number of human bodies. \u201cIt just looked like confetti that had been thrown around it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut each of those pieces of confetti was the shirt or dress or something of a dead person.\u201d\u00a0 Just two days\u00a0before, on November 18, 1978, Jones compelled\u00a0many in\u00a0his congregation to consume a cyanide cocktail and end their lives. Though he had trained the community to prepare for\u00a0their deaths, there is evidence that some people may have been forced to consume the poison unwillingly or had it injected into them.\u00a0 Many fathers, mothers, children, teachers, and nurses remained\u00a0where they had fallen. For the first responders who arrived days after the massacre, it was a scene they would never forget.\u00a0 Ages 7-12 Since Jonestown\u2019s population was primarily Americans, officials called in\u00a0the U.S. military to gather information. Netterville and his team did not know what happened there\u2014only that Congressman Leo Ryan had been gunned down near the commune. Both Netterville and Krause remember the same thing about approaching the site: the unmistakable, horrific smell of death. The scent even invaded the helicopters high above. As Netterville explains, \u201cA human body is the worst smell you can ever smell. Multiply a dead cow times ten.\u201d To mask the odor as much as possible, he eventually fashioned a mask by \u201ccut[ting] a bandana out of a pillowcase and put[ting] Old Spice lotion on it.\u201d The bodies, already attracting bugs, were decomposing in the heat and humidity. \u201cThe bodies were so bloated that [\u2026] it was very hard to distinguish who they were,\u201d says Krause, who was one of the first journalists to arrive at Jonestown after the massacre. The scene was made even more horrific when the first responders noticed the children, who ranged in age from babies to teenagers. Netterville recalls, \u201cSome of the people that died were actually holding onto their children.\u201d Animals weren\u2019t spared: Netterville remembers seeing the bodies of murdered dogs. Someone had even taken the time to shoot Mr. Muggs, a chimpanzee that came with Peoples Temple from California. \u201cI just could not believe it. Why would you kill the animals?\u201d Netterville remembers his team divided the land into sections and started counting corpses, one after the other. They initially calculated 450 bodies. When they radioed headquarters with the tally, Netterville remembers \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to believe us\u2026 They had us repeat that number three times.\u201d As horrific as that number was, it turned out to be a massive undercount. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know there were people underneath. They were laying on top of each other,\u201d Netterville recalls. With each new discovery, the death toll of the November massacre climbed higher and higher. The final total was 918 souls, 909 of whom died on site. Now a ghost town, Jonestown eerily exhibited remnants of the commune\u2019s final, chaotic hours\u2013\u2013paper cups strewn across the ground, syringes scattered on tables, people holding onto each other as death came for them. A 55-gallon drum was found containing a purplish\u00a0concoction\u2013\u2013a cocktail of cyanide, sedatives, and Flavor-Aid. Netterville remembers military personnel dumped it out on the ground.\u00a0 Jim Jones\u2019s cabin acted as a window into how he ran the Peoples Temple.\u00a0 \u201cHe had several pictures there of his family,\u201d Netterville says. He had leveraged his interracial family to manipulate the press and members of the congregation while he tried to dodge allegations of abuse within the community. Netterville used a crowbar he found to pry open a large safe in Jones\u2019s house. \u201cIt was full of social security checks\u201d from the senior residents who contributed their monthly payments to the commune, he remembers. It also included \u201cboxes of passports. [Jones] took the passports so that people could not leave.\u201d Some had managed to escape death in those final hours, however. Odell Rhodes had seen the early stages of the massacre before hiding and fleeing to a nearby village. Hyacinth Thrash was asleep in her bed when the killings started, and so she survived. Tim Carter, another survivor, was tasked with a special mission just as the killings began on November 18. One of Jones\u2019s mistresses asked him to take suitcases of money to the embassy of the Soviet Union in Georgetown. The assignment enabled Carter to walk out of Jonestown alive\u2013\u2013but not before seeing his wife and baby die. \u201cAfter that, I was beyond even thinking. All I heard in my brain is, \u2018You cannot die, you cannot die, you cannot die, you must live, you must live, you must live.\u2019\u201d The ones who didn\u2019t survive left Jonestown in body bags. Some were claimed by their family and privately buried. The remaining 409 were interred in a mass grave in Oakland, California. Though the work of first responders was over, the act of witnessing Jonestown\u2019s horror left its mark. After using Old Spice to mask the stench of death, the scent still haunts Netterville. \u201cI don\u2019t use [Old Spice] anymore. I can\u2019t stand the smell of it ever again.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved",

        "title": "How the rainbow flag became a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ community",
        "text": "The Pride flag is continuously evolving, with the latest intersex-inclusive design highlighting diverse identities within the community. The iconic rainbow Pride flag, often seen adorning homes, businesses, and car bumpers worldwide, is much more than a colorful display. It stands as a vibrant testament to LGBTQIA+ pride, a symbol of safe spaces, and an emblem of unwavering support. \u201cThe LGBTQ+ community exists everywhere\u2014exemplified by the rainbow,\u201d says Robert Kesten, executive director of the Stonewall Museum. In preparation for the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Freedom Day Parade on June 25, 1978, California\u2019s first openly gay elected official, Harvey Milk, commissioned Gilbert Baker\u2014an openly gay veteran, drag queen, activist, and artist\u2014to create a symbol representing the LGBTQIA+ community. Baker\u2019s eight-colored rainbow-striped flag, which he felt expressed the LGBTQIA+ community\u2019s joy, beauty, and power, was inspired by the American flag. \u201cIn the late 1970s, national pride was at a peak because of the bicentennial, and homophobia was rife in U.S. society. Using national symbols for queer pride resonated with many queer people,\u201d says Christopher Ewing, assistant professor of history at Purdue University. The original configuration included pink to signify sex; red, life; orange, healing; yellow, sunlight; green, nature; turquoise, magic; blue, harmony; and purple, spirit. After the assassination of Harvey Milk in November 1978, demand for the flag increased, leading to the removal of the pink and turquoise stripes due to manufacturing constraints. The six remaining rainbow colors then became the enduring symbol of gay pride. (From LGBT to LGBTQIA+: The evolving recognition of identity.) Baker\u2019s rainbow flag has been updated many times to be more inclusive. \u201cThe evolution of the rainbow flag reflects how the queer community continues to grapple with issues of race and gender. Recent iterations of the flag center queer BIPOC and gender nonconforming people who face discrimination in queer spaces,\u201d says Cookie Woolner, associate professor of history at the University of Memphis. In 2017, the Philly Pride flag was unveiled at Philadelphia City Hall, created by Philadelphia\u2019s Office of LGBT Affairs under the leadership of Amber Hikes. This version features black and brown stripes at the top to include the QTBIPOC (Queer, Trans*, Black, Indigenous People of Color) community that has historically been excluded from queer movements despite facing prejudice and violence as double minorities. \u201cThe involvement of QTBIPOC was central to the Stonewall rebellion. These additions pay homage to them and center them,\u201d says Rebekkah Mulholland, assistant professor of history at CSU Sacramento. In 2018, the rainbow emblem was updated by nonbinary artist Daniel Quasar to include the white, pale pink, and blue stripes of the trans* pride flag, symbolizing a commitment to greater inclusivity. \u201cThe Progress Pride flag is about resisting the erasure of QTBIPOC within the movement,\u201d Ewing says. \u201cIt reincorporates pink, one of the original colors that was jettisoned in a new context.\u201d (How rural queer communities connect through storytelling.) The black and brown stripes form a chevron shape filled with the light blue, pink, and white colors of the trans* flag. \u201cIt\u2019s important to center trans* people because they\u2019ve often been on the front lines of activism and faced the most repercussions due to their often-visible gender transgression,\u201d Woolner says. In 2020, a new LGBTQIA+ rainbow pride flag emerged\u2014The Queer People of Color flag. Although the designer remains unknown, the banner highlights queer and racial equity by incorporating the Black Lives Matter motif of a raised fist in a gradient of skin tones. Ewing says that the \u201cpolitical movement that led to the creation of the rainbow flag in the late 1970s is unimaginable without the contributions of QTBIPOC\u201d and that centering QTBIPOC \u201casserts the unmovable place of people of color in the LGBTQIA+ movement.\u201d The most recent iteration of the pride flag, the Intersex-Inclusive Pride flag, was crafted in 2021 by Valentino Vecchietti, an intersex columnist and media personality. \u201cPride flags exist not to contain or delineate us, but to reflect our diverse existence and to create inclusive visibility,\u201d she says. \u201cInclusion cannot be assumed; it matters that we can see it.\u201d The flag builds upon the Progress Pride design by incorporating a purple circle within a yellow triangle, symbolizing intersex pride. With 11 colors, it\u2019s a subtle nod to the original rainbow pride emblem. (See this photographer documents her own gender transition.) Baker\u2019s flag has undergone numerous revisions \u2014 and will likely continue to be reimagined. \u201cThe more we see how broad the spectrum of human identity is, the more iterations of the flag will be,\u201d Kesten says. \u201cIn a community as vibrant, creative, and [engaged in activism] as this one, the flag will continue to evolve.\u201d Ages 7-12 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "He was a Founding Father. His son sided with the British.",
        "text": "Benjamin Franklin had an exceptionally close bond with his son\u2014until the American Revolution pitted them against each other. To generations of Americans, Benjamin Franklin is a Founding Father. But to William Franklin, his only surviving son, he was simply \u201cfather.\u201d The two men had an exceptionally close bond, and Benjamin affectionately shepherded his son\u2019s budding career. Yet the very thing that cemented Benjamin Franklin\u2019s legacy also threatened to destroy his relationship with his son. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Benjamin sided with the colonies\u2013\u2013and William sided with the crown. Could their relationship survive the war? Benjamin Franklin became a father when William entered the world sometime around 1730. The child\u2019s exact birth date remains a mystery, as does his mother\u2019s identity. There was a good reason for that: William was illegitimate. Benjamin was committed to raising his child and seeing to it that the circumstances of his birth would not define him. Benjamin entered a common-law marriage with Deborah Read, his former sweetheart in Philadelphia, in 1730. Benjamin and William were a packaged deal, and Read had no choice but to accept her husband\u2019s illegitimate son. (Do you have a morning routine? Here's how Ben Franklin started his day.) Two more children followed. Francis Folger Franklin was born in 1732, but tragically contracted smallpox and died when he was only four years old. In 1743, Deborah Franklin gave birth to Sally, a daughter. That made William his father\u2019s only surviving male heir. And Benjamin had great expectations for him. \u00a0Benjamin Franklin had been a self-made man, but he saw to it that his son wouldn\u2019t have to be. He hired tutors to educate William from the age of four until he was old enough to go to an academy serving Philadelphia\u2019s well-to-do families. Benjamin was preparing William to become a gentleman. Ages 7-12 He also steered his son into a life of service to the colonial state. William served in King George\u2019s War from 1746 to 1747 before taking on positions as a clerk in Pennsylvania\u2019s colonial assembly and with the postal service.\u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin\u2019s strong bond with his son only deepened as William grew up. William Strahan, a family friend, described William as his father\u2019s \u201cfriend, his brother, his intimate, and easy companion.\u201d When Benjamin Franklin went to London in 1757, he brought his son with him. Benjamin would act as Pennsylvania\u2019s colonial agent; William would study law. Together, they toured the country, made notable friends, and excitedly witnessed the coronation of King George III in 1761. (The legacy of George III\u2014the last king of America.) When William Franklin returned to the colonies in 1763, he did so with a wife\u2013\u2013Elizabeth Downes\u2013\u2013and a new appointment: Royal Governor of New Jersey.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nTo generations of Americans, Benjamin Franklin is a Founding Father. But to William Franklin, his only surviving son, he was simply \u201cfather.\u201d The two men had an exceptionally close bond, and Benjamin affectionately shepherded his son\u2019s budding career. Yet the very thing that cemented Benjamin Franklin\u2019s legacy also threatened to destroy his relationship with his son. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Benjamin sided with the colonies\u2013\u2013and William sided with the crown. Could their relationship survive the war?\n\nBenjamin Franklin became a father when William entered the world sometime around 1730. The child\u2019s exact birth date remains a mystery, as does his mother\u2019s identity. There was a good reason for that: William was illegitimate. Benjamin was committed to raising his child and seeing to it that the circumstances of his birth would not define him. Benjamin entered a common-law marriage with Deborah Read, his former sweetheart in Philadelphia, in 1730. Benjamin and William were a packaged deal, and Read had no choice but to accept her husband\u2019s illegitimate son.\n\nTwo more children followed. Francis Folger Franklin was born in 1732, but tragically contracted smallpox and died when he was only four years old. In 1743, Deborah Franklin gave birth to Sally, a daughter. That made William his father\u2019s only surviving male heir. And Benjamin had great expectations for him.  Benjamin Franklin had been a self-made man, but he saw to it that his son wouldn\u2019t have to be. He hired tutors to educate William from the age of four until he was old enough to go to an academy serving Philadelphia\u2019s well-to-do families. Benjamin was preparing William to become a gentleman.\n\nAges 7-12 He also steered his son into a life of service to the colonial state. William served in King George\u2019s War from 1746 to 1747 before taking on positions as a clerk in Pennsylvania\u2019s colonial assembly and with the postal service.   Benjamin\u2019s strong bond with his son only deepened as William grew up. William Strahan, a family friend, described William as his father\u2019s \u201cfriend, his brother, his intimate, and easy companion.\u201d When Benjamin Franklin went to London in 1757, he brought his son with him. Benjamin would act as Pennsylvania\u2019s colonial agent; William would study law. Together, they toured the country, made notable friends, and excitedly witnessed the coronation of King George III in 1761.\n\nWhen William Franklin returned to the colonies in 1763, he did so with a wife\u2013\u2013Elizabeth Downes\u2013\u2013and a new appointment: Royal Governor of New Jersey. He took his role seriously, applying his legal education to the administration of a British colony. He governed New Jersey during a trying time. A series of taxes and policies provoked the ire of many colonists, whose calls for independence from the British Empire began to crescendo. Why should Parliament, an institution in which they had no direct representation, hold any authority over them?

        "text": "Generations continue to grapple with ghostly tales along the incomplete \"Road to Nowhere\" and its dead-end tunnel in North Carolina. High above Fontana Lake on the North Carolina side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park lies the Road to Nowhere: a winding 6.5-mile pass that dead ends at a 1200-foot tunnel accessible only by foot. If you walk it at night, the wind blows cold, voices carry, and the darkness seems to last forever. The park and nearby town Bryson City market the Road to Nowhere as a tourist attraction, and locals like Eligiah Thornton grew up hearing chilling tales of supernatural danger. There\u2019s \u201ca weird shadow over the place,\u201d he says.\u00a0 But what\u2019s truly haunting is the tunnel\u2019s unsettling history. In the 1940s, to facilitate the construction of Fontana Lake and Dam, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) assured approximately 200 Appalachia families that they would construct a road to enable them to visit their ancestral cemeteries in exchange for relocating their homes. However, in 1969, the government halted construction due to concerns about potential acid runoff from exposed rocks.\u00a0 Although the National Park Service eventually agreed to compensate Swain County with $52 million instead of completing the road in 2010, this financial settlement has not resolved the ongoing issue: providing these families assistance accessing the 26 cemeteries now situated miles away from the lakeshore, accessible only via steep and poorly maintained trails. \u201cThe promise was not a financial settlement. The promise was to build the road,\u201d says Karen Marcus, a psychologist in her 60s who has five generations of ancestors across multiple gravesites. \u201cThe promise will never be kept.\u201d The Road to Nowhere families were the last of 50,000 people across six Southern Appalachian states forced to relocate so the TVA could build 15 hydroelectric dams from 1933 to 1943. While the company claims this decade of construction \u201ctransform[ed] the poverty-stricken, often-flooded Valley into a modern, electrified, and developed slice of America,\u201d the reality of life in the Fontana Basin was far from the stereotype of the isolated, uneducated, impoverished mountain dweller.\u00a0 \u201cThis was an industrial area,\u201d says Daniel S. Pierce, a history professor at the University of North Carolina, Asheville.\u00a0 As railroads began winding through the rugged terrain in the late 1880s, logging and mining companies followed closely behind, giving rise to thriving towns such as Proctor, Bushnell, and Judson\u2014all of which were flooded and destroyed when the Fontana Dam, the largest east of the Mississippi River, was created in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack to power a nearby aluminum plant.\u00a0 (These ancient mountains witnessed the birth of man and monster.) While most families impacted saw their towns buried underwater, the homes of the 200 families on what\u2019s now called the North Shore sat above the watermark. But their only access road to their family cemeteries, did not. Instead of moving these families\u2019 loved ones, the TVA promised to build a new road so Decoration Days, an annual Appalachian tradition, which folklorist Alan Jabbour described as \u201can act of respect for the dead that reaffirms one\u2019s bonds with those who have gone before,\u201d could continue.\u00a0 \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have found a better people\u2014mountain people\u2014to be understand[ing of] the war effort and want to contribute,\u201d says Leeunah Woods, whose mother, Helen Cable Vance, grew up there.\u00a0 According to Lance Hardin, who studied the dam\u2019s impact on these families, the TVA took advantage of this generosity of spirit, paying property owners an average of $38 per acre\u2014less than most relocated families received.\u00a0 As a result, land ownership among North Shore residents dropped by a quarter, and home ownership fell by nearly half. \u201cA lot of the available, small farms were gone, and so a lot of them really struggled to find something nearby that could be a replacement to what they were losing,\u201d says Hardin. (Is building more dams the way to save rivers?) Pierce says that\u2019s a key reason why the cemeteries hold such profound importance for these families: \u201cThey\u2019ve lost their homes, they\u2019ve lost their businesses, they lost their schools\u2014you know, all the markers of community. But here\u2019s what\u2019s left.\u201d\u00a0 As years passed and no road appeared, families would make their own way to their cemeteries for Decoration Days. In the 1960s, \u201cus boys would go fishing, and the men would go to the cemeteries and clean them off,\u201d says Henry Chambers, chairman of the North Shore Cemetery Association. \u201cJust being able to come over here was special.\u201d\u00a0 In 1977, after over 650 people attended a reunion the year prior for the nation\u2019s Bicentennial, Helen Vance and her kin created the North Shore Cemetery Association to advocate for the road to be finished and, in the meantime, get government help to access their cemeteries. Since 1984, park rangers have ferried families across Fontana Lake and maintained trails for these annual visits from April to October. Chambers estimates the yearly costs, from travel costs to repairing graves damaged by weather and wild animals, to be about $8,000. (See pictures of death and burial rituals from different cultures.) To attend a Decoration Day is to understand how connected these families are to their shared history and what they call the \u201chomeplace.\u201d They clean the tombstones and decorate the graves with colorful cloth flowers. After the group sings \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d Marcus reads a self-penned reflection before leading a prayer. Then it\u2019s time for a potluck, when the stories flow long and winding as the creeks that rush nearby.\u00a0 Lillian Hyatt shared her scrapbook with articles profiling her great-grandmother Sarah Palestine \u201cTiney\u201d Kirkland, a midwife who delivered 627 babies and designed many home chimneys. Frank March, an amateur historian from Tennessee, recalled the day 83-year-old Joe Cable, Sr. said that the sheet metal March found on his family\u2019s old chimney was the fender of his brother\u2019s bicycle. \u201cHe was so excited to be back there,\u201d March says.\u00a0 \u201cThe park wants everybody to believe the Smokies is wilderness. [But] it has never been wilderness,\u201d Chambers says. Together and independently, he and March have mapped over 2700 sites\u2014including homes, churches, schools, and mills\u2014across the park\u2019s 522,000 acres to prove their point.\u00a0 As for the Road to Nowhere\u2019s reputation, the North Shore families don\u2019t put much store in it. \u201cThere\u2019s no ghostly whatever,\u201d says Woods. \u201cIt\u2019s just an eerie feeling in that long of a tunnel to walk.\u201d\u00a0 With its cold concrete and graffitied stone, the Road to Nowhere is a dead place, not a place of the dead.

        "title": "Your khaki pants have a history that may surprise you",
        "text": "The British first began wearing khaki during their occupation of India. The tan-colored tactical camouflage soon spread across the world. In early 19th century India, against the arid and rocky landscape where sparse vegetation clings to craggy hillsides, the British Army\u2019s iconic red coats made them vulnerable. For the first time, they had to consider being less conspicuous, showing less flare. \u201cThe 19th century was a period of small colonial wars, and the British Army learned a lot out at the edges of the empire. They learned a lot about uniform and how better to be strategic\u2014how to use the uniform as something that was integral to battlefield action,\u201d said Jane Tynan, cultural historian and the author of British Army Uniform and the First World War: Men in Khaki. The solution was khaki, a drab brown color that evoked the environment soldiers occupied in India during the colonial period. In fact, \u201ckhaki\u201d is an Urdu word for \u201cdust-colored.\u201d Khaki was the first widely adopted use of camouflage technology in military uniforms. Tim Newark, author of Brassey\u2019s Book of Uniforms, called khaki \u201cthe greatest change of all to the future of uniforms.\u201d In its 176-year history, khaki has continued to be a common military uniform, but has also become the uniform of youth, business, and adventure, carrying its colonial connotations with it through history. The first use of khaki fabric in military uniforms is attributed to Sir Harry Lumsden, founder of the Corps of Guides in India and his second-in-command William Hodson. Established in 1846 during the British East India Company\u2019s occupation, the Corps of Guides was made up of Indian soldiers who acted as scouts and participated in combat on behalf of the British Indian Army. In 1848, Hodson said he would \u201cmake [the Guides] invisible in a land of dust.\u201d Early khaki uniforms were created by dying white cotton fabric with mud from the region. Around the turn of the 20th century, troops began to source dyed fabric from England. During this period, Britain primarily imported cotton from the United States and its colonies in India and Egypt. Khaki military uniforms were the first widespread use of tactical camouflage, and the light fabric was more suitable for combat in warm regions. In 1897, khaki became the official uniform for all British troops overseas. Other armies soon began to use khaki uniforms, including the U.S. Rough Riders fighting in the Spanish-American War and South African soldiers in the Boer War. Khaki has been used to describe a range of shades of cream, yellowish tan, light brown, and grayish green (also called \u201cdrab\u201d), and the use of these shades in military uniforms continued to spread during World War I and World War II. Popular civilian uses of khaki took hold in this period, including khaki clothes for outdoor laborers in mining and agriculture, as well as recreational activities like tennis, golf, hiking, and camping. In the early 20th century, a romantic image of khaki-clad adventurers exploring new lands, studying \u201cexotic\u201d cultures, and conquering wildlife on safari arose. This romanticized image of khaki fueled its appeal among civilians, who sought to emulate the attire of explorers and adventurers. In the U.S., khaki grew in popularity among the working class and people exploring the outdoors like Teddy Roosevelt. According to Tracey Panek, historian for Levi Strauss, the company started marketing khaki clothes suitable for outdoor activities in the 1910s. Levi Strauss went on to create khaki products that appealed to G.I.s returning after the war, college students, and later the Dockers brand of khaki pants that launched the business casual revolution in the 1990s. Civilian khaki fashions permeated the 20th century, and was popular with manual laborers, preppy students, businessmen, and school children, but khaki has always retained its military connotations. Today, fashion historians are rethinking the once-romanticized colonial aesthetic. Historian Tynan said the mid-century khaki adventurer\u2019s uniform is a conspicuous nod to colonial military and police dress. \u201cWhen I see these characters, these anthropologists and adventurers in the early 20th century wearing these clothes, I think it looks very imperialistic to me. It's a hangover from the past, where they are marking themselves out as being the person who's in charge and the person who is studying colonial bodies,\u201d she said. Climate and fashion activist C\u00e9line Semaan has observed that peak popularity of khaki pants (and other military gear like combat boots and bomber jackets) occurred during times of heightened global military activity like the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the invasion of Iraq after 9/11. \u201cThere's this idea that the khaki pants, the military boots, these bomber jackets, the camouflage pants, and the whole gear represents this idea of freedom and power. It becomes an aspiration, really, for the general public to see the military as cool, fashionable, something that they want to look like,\u201d she said, \u201cWhenever it comes back on the floor, and it's being sold as fashionable again, it's because there is a geopolitical agenda often that is at play.\u201d Ages 7-12 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

In fact, \u201ckhaki\u201d is an Urdu word for \u201cdust-colored.\u201d Khaki was the first widely adopted use of camouflage technology in military uniforms. Tim Newark, author of Brassey\u2019s Book of Uniforms, called khaki \u201cthe greatest change of all to the future of uniforms.\u201d\n\nIn its 176-year history, khaki has continued to be a common military uniform, but has also become the uniform of youth, business, and adventure, carrying its colonial connotations with it through history. The first use of khaki fabric in military uniforms is attributed to Sir Harry Lumsden, founder of the Corps of Guides in India and his second-in-command William Hodson.\n\nEstablished in 1846 during the British East India Company\u2019s occupation, the Corps of Guides was made up of Indian soldiers who acted as scouts and participated in combat on behalf of the British Indian Army. In 1848, Hodson said he would \u201cmake [the Guides] invisible in a land of dust.\u201d Early khaki uniforms were created by dying white cotton fabric with mud from the region. Around the turn of the 20th century, troops began to source dyed fabric from England.\n\nDuring this period, Britain primarily imported cotton from the United States and its colonies in India and Egypt. Khaki military uniforms were the first widespread use of tactical camouflage, and the light fabric was more suitable for combat in warm regions. In 1897, khaki became the official uniform for all British troops overseas. Other armies soon began to use khaki uniforms, including the U.S. Rough Riders fighting in the Spanish-American War and South African soldiers in the Boer War.\n\nKhaki has been used to describe a range of shades of cream, yellowish tan, light brown, and grayish green (also called \u201cdrab\u201d), and the use of these shades in military uniforms continued to spread during World War I and World War II. Popular civilian uses of khaki took hold in this period, including khaki clothes for outdoor laborers in mining and agriculture, as well as recreational activities like tennis, golf, hiking, and camping.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a romantic image of khaki-clad adventurers exploring new lands, studying \u201cexotic\u201d cultures, and conquering wildlife on safari arose. This romanticized image of khaki fueled its appeal among civilians, who sought to emulate the attire of explorers and adventurers. In the U.S., khaki grew in popularity among the working class and people exploring the outdoors like Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nAccording to Tracey Panek, historian for Levi Strauss, the company started marketing khaki clothes suitable for outdoor activities in the 1910s. Levi Strauss went on to create khaki products that appealed to G.I.s returning after the war, college students, and later the Dockers brand of khaki pants that launched the business casual revolution in the 1990s.\n\nCivilian khaki fashions permeated the 20th century, and was popular with manual laborers, preppy students, businessmen, and school children, but khaki has always retained its military connotations. Today, fashion historians are rethinking the once-romanticized colonial aesthetic. Historian Tynan said the mid-century khaki adventurer\u2019s uniform is a conspicuous nod to colonial military and police dress.\n\n\u201cWhen I see these characters, these anthropologists and adventurers in the early 20th century wearing these clothes, I think it looks very imperialistic to me. It's a hangover from the past, where they are marking themselves out as being the person who's in charge and the person who is studying colonial bodies,\u201d she said.\n\nClimate and fashion activist C\u00e9line Semaan has observed that peak popularity of khaki pants (and other military gear like combat boots and bomber jackets) occurred during times of heightened global military activity like the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the invasion of Iraq after 9/11. \u201cThere's this idea that the khaki pants, the military boots, these bomber jackets, the camouflage pants, and the whole gear represents this idea of freedom and power. It becomes an aspiration, really, for the general public to see the military as cool, fashionable, something that they want to look like,\u201d she said, \u201cWhenever it comes back on the floor, and it's being sold as fashionable again, it's because there is a geopolitical agenda often that is at play.\u201d"

        "title": "Should couples normalize sleeping in separate beds?",
        "text": "If your partner snores, experiences insomnia, or has a different body clock, sleeping apart might offer a solution. New research from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reveals that more than a third of Americans choose to \u201csleep divorce\u201d their partners, reflecting a growing trend among couples, including celebrities such as Cameron Diaz and Carson Daly, to prioritize sleep quality.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve been conned by the idea we should sleep together if we\u2019re in a relationship,\u201d says Neil Stanley, coauthor of A Sleep Divorce: How to Sleep Apart, Not Fall Apart. Sleep divorce involves couples sleeping in separate beds or bedrooms to improve sleep quality. This practice helps avoid common sleep disturbances like snoring, insomnia, differing sleep schedules, and restlessness, which can lead to fatigue and relationship tension. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the trend and its potential benefits for your health. In ancient Rome, the concept of the marital bed, known as \u201clectus genialis,\u201d was both practical and symbolic. Roman couples often used one bed for intimate conversations and physical intimacy, making it a private space within the home. It was not unusual for them to retire to separate\u00a0beds when it was time to sleep. (These are the mysteries that science is unlocking about sleep.) However, during the medieval period, the concept of a dedicated marital bed was less distinct due to the communal nature of living spaces. More impoverished families often shared one bed or sleeping area near a heat source, while wealthier families could claim individual rooms since they lived in larger homes.\u00a0 The Renaissance saw the emergence of more private sleeping quarters for couples. However, separate bedrooms for husbands and wives, especially among royalty and the nobility, were not uncommon, as depicted in the TV series The Crown\u00a0and\u00a0Bridgerton. It became fashionable for couples to sleep together in the Victorian era, but by the late 19th century, medical experts called for a separation once more. In her book, A Cultural History of Twin Beds, Hilary Hinds says that medical professionals of the time considered separate beds the healthiest option. Prominent figures like New York physician William Witty Hall and alternative health practitioner Edwin Bowers emphasized the health benefits of single beds, with Hall advocating for \u201ca single bed in a large, clean, light room\u201d and Bowers arguing that \u201cseparate beds for every sleeper are as necessary as separate dishes for every eater.\u201d (Here are seven science-backed tips for better sleep.) By the 1920s, twin beds became a symbol of wealth and fashion. However, the 1950s saw a shift back to double beds, as the post-World War II era solidified the master bedroom concept, viewing separate beds as a sign of a failing marriage. Today, as awareness of sleep\u2019s role in overall health grows, the trend of separate sleeping arrangements is making a comeback. Some couples find that sharing a bed enhances their emotional connection and intimacy. For others, not so much.\u00a0 Sleep psychologist Dan Ford, the clinical director of the Better Sleep Clinic in New Zealand, says there are an array of reasons couples might feel more comfortable sleeping alone. Your partner could snore, or they could suffer, as one in 10 people do, from chronic insomnia. \u201cSome couples have very different body clocks, leading to different sleep timing preferences, so they find it is easier to sleep in separate beds rather than disturb one another,\u201d Ford says. A study from the University of Michigan found that sharing a bed can compromise sleep quality, potentially straining relationships. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that following a poor night\u2019s sleep, couples will experience more fights.\u00a0 (Are you a lark or an owl? Your body clock holds the answer.) Tami Shadduck, a teacher from the United States, had many sleepless nights due to her husband\u2019s sleep apnoea. She moved into another room during the pandemic when she had strep throat and never moved back. \u201cSleep is sleep, and intimacy isn\u2019t built while you\u2019re unconscious,\u201d she says. \u201cIntimacy is created in a million little moments while you are awake.\u201d Stanley says the key to making sleep divorce work is you shouldn\u2019t call the second room the spare room. \u201cIt should be your room,\u201d says Stanley. \u201cYou have it the decorated the way you want with the mattress, duvet, and pillows you want.\u201d While a sleep divorce can improve sleep quality and reduce disturbances, for some couples, it may cause feelings of emotional disconnection and reduce spontaneous intimacy. (Women are more likely to be sleep deprived. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s so bad.) Yet, for others, separate rooms can boost a relationship. When Utah-based author Marcella Hill moved into her own room a year ago, she said on TikTok, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sexy to be able to invite each other over. I think this should be the new norm.\u201d Stanley says that sleeping separately has nothing to do with the strength of your relationship. \u201cIt is a perfectly normal thing to do,\u201d he says. \u201cSleep divorce isn\u2019t a punishment, it is doing the best for each other.\u201d Ages 7-12 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "They were rock stars of paleontology\u2014and their feud was legendary",
        "text": "Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope each discovered troves of dinosaur fossils in the 19th century\u2014but grew obsessed with bringing each other down in the Bone Wars. They were rock star scholars\u2014yet their epic public feud threatened to destroy both of their careers. Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope were two of the 19th century\u2019s most prolific bone hunters. They discovered more than a hundred dinosaurs between them\u2014including Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Lystrosaurus\u2014at the dawn of paleontology. Although they both found fame and success, they hated each other for it. Their animosity devolved into an all-out war, and they used an arsenal of underhanded tactics to sabotage one another, including bribery, cheating, and defamation. The men\u2019s tactics may have been cold-blooded, but their so-called \u201cBone Wars\u201d yielded scientific discoveries that helped shape paleontology as we know it. Despite the mutual hatred that would come to define their relationship, Marsh and Cope started as friends. Othniel Marsh was born in New York in 1831 to a family of modest means. Yet he had one significant family connection: His uncle was George Peabody, a fabulously wealthy entrepreneur who bankrolled his nephew\u2019s education. The brilliant young scientist graduated from Yale and would hold the institution\u2019s first chair in paleontology beginning in 1866. If Marsh was born into a position of uncertainty, then Edward Cope entered the world in 1840 fully confident in his place within it. Cope\u2019s family had wealth, standing, and connection in Philadelphia\u2014and the only question he faced about his future was whether he could escape the path his family intended for him. His father wanted him to become a gentleman landowner; Edward wanted to become a scientist. In 1863, Cope\u2019s father sent him to Europe. In Berlin, he befriended a rising star in the field of natural sciences: Othniel Marsh. As young American scholars abroad, they likely bonded over their shared interest in paleontology, a relatively young academic field focused on the study of ancient fossils. After their return to the United States, the two men exchanged letters and even named newly discovered species after each other. Cope anointed one species Ptyonius marshii; Marsh dubbed his own discovery Mosasaurus copeanus. \u00a0There was a core issue, however. Paleontology was still nascent, and the field\u2019s newness fueled a brewing competition between Marsh and Cope as they sought to anoint themselves its leader. The rush to stake their claim in the field pulled them apart. Scholars have different theories as to what specific incident kickstarted their feud. Some say it began in 1868 when Marsh visited Cope on a fossil-finding expedition at a quarry in New Jersey. Marsh went behind Cope\u2019s back to cut a deal with the quarry owners to deliver new fossils to him, not Cope. Cope biographer Jane Davidson dated the feud to the same year, when Cope published a description of Elasmosaurus platyurus, a newly identified species. In reconstructing the creature, Cope made a serious error: He flipped the animal\u2019s tail and neck. Marsh called out Cope and rubbed his colleague\u2019s nose in the mistake. Humiliated, Cope scrambled to buy up copies of the journal that published his error. But it was too late\u2014Marsh would never let Cope, or the scientific community, forget the blunder. The American West was fertile land for uncovering prehistoric fossils, but it wasn\u2019t big enough for the two men. They rushed to rake up fossils and make greater discoveries than the other. In 1871, Cope descended on a site in Kansas that Marsh\u2019s team had recently abandoned. Cope\u2019s dig yielded the skeleton of an ancient flying reptile\u2014and it was bigger than the one Marsh had turned up. Cope delighted in the find; Marsh fumed. As their war heated up, Marsh and Cope resorted to different methods to undermine one another, including accusations of plagiarism, spying, and rushing to out-publish each other. For good measure, Cope purchased the journal American Naturalist and used it as a forum to criticize Marsh and his work. The rivalry escalated when they both maintained crews at dig sites in Como Bluff, Wyoming, from 1877 to 1879. Marsh even directed his crew to destroy any remaining bones at the site before they departed so that Cope couldn\u2019t get them.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nOthniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope were two of the 19th century\u2019s most prolific bone hunters. They discovered more than a hundred dinosaurs between them\u2014including Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Lystrosaurus\u2014at the dawn of paleontology. Although they both found fame and success, they hated each other for it. Their animosity devolved into an all-out war, and they used an arsenal of underhanded tactics to sabotage one another, including bribery, cheating, and defamation. The men\u2019s tactics may have been cold-blooded, but their so-called \u201cBone Wars\u201d yielded scientific discoveries that helped shape paleontology as we know it.\n\nDespite the mutual hatred that would come to define their relationship, Marsh and Cope started as friends. Othniel Marsh was born in New York in 1831 to a family of modest means. Yet he had one significant family connection: His uncle was George Peabody, a fabulously wealthy entrepreneur who bankrolled his nephew\u2019s education. The brilliant young scientist graduated from Yale and would hold the institution\u2019s first chair in paleontology beginning in 1866.\n\nIf Marsh was born into a position of uncertainty, then Edward Cope entered the world in 1840 fully confident in his place within it. Cope\u2019s family had wealth, standing, and connection in Philadelphia\u2014and the only question he faced about his future was whether he could escape the path his family intended for him. His father wanted him to become a gentleman landowner; Edward wanted to become a scientist.\n\nIn 1863, Cope\u2019s father sent him to Europe. In Berlin, he befriended a rising star in the field of natural sciences: Othniel Marsh. As young American scholars abroad, they likely bonded over their shared interest in paleontology, a relatively young academic field focused on the study of ancient fossils. After their return to the United States, the two men exchanged letters and even named newly discovered species after each other. Cope anointed one species Ptyonius marshii; Marsh dubbed his own discovery Mosasaurus copeanus.\n\nThere was a core issue, however. Paleontology was still nascent, and the field\u2019s newness fueled a brewing competition between Marsh and Cope as they sought to anoint themselves its leader. The rush to stake their claim in the field pulled them apart. Scholars have different theories as to what specific incident kickstarted their feud. Some say it began in 1868 when Marsh visited Cope on a fossil-finding expedition at a quarry in New Jersey. Marsh went behind Cope\u2019s back to cut a deal with the quarry owners to deliver new fossils to him, not Cope.\n\nCope biographer Jane Davidson dated the feud to the same year, when Cope published a description of Elasmosaurus platyurus, a newly identified species. In reconstructing the creature, Cope made a serious error: He flipped the animal\u2019s tail and neck. Marsh called out Cope and rubbed his colleague\u2019s nose in the mistake. Humiliated, Cope scrambled to buy up copies of the journal that published his error. But it was too late\u2014Marsh would never let Cope, or the scientific community, forget the blunder.\n\nThe American West was fertile land for uncovering prehistoric fossils, but it wasn\u2019t big enough for the two men. They rushed to rake up fossils and make greater discoveries than the other. In 1871, Cope descended on a site in Kansas that Marsh\u2019s team had recently abandoned. Cope\u2019s dig yielded the skeleton of an ancient flying reptile\u2014and it was bigger than the one Marsh had turned up. Cope delighted in the find; Marsh fumed.\n\nAs their war heated up, Marsh and Cope resorted to different methods to undermine one another, including accusations of plagiarism, spying, and rushing to out-publish each other. For good measure, Cope purchased the journal American Naturalist and used it as a forum to criticize Marsh and his work. The rivalry escalated when they both maintained crews at dig sites in Como Bluff, Wyoming, from 1877 to 1879. Marsh even directed his crew to destroy any remaining bones at the site before they departed so that Cope couldn\u2019t get them.\n\nMarsh took a job with the U.S. Geological Survey as its chief paleontologist in 1882. The plumb position gave Marsh the backing of the government to legitimize and support his work. It also meant that he would get plenty of funding\u2013\u2013and Cope, lacking the right political connections, wouldn\u2019t.

        "text": "King Charles III\u2019s official portrait is stirring conversation, but it\u2019s far from the first to do so. Throughout history, portraits have often been sources of controversy, blending fact and fiction. In King Charles III\u2019s new official portrait, the monarch is depicted amid a sea of red with a butterfly near his shoulder. Its debut sparked discussion around the world: Was the striking color meant to be about his legacy? A statement about the Crown's past? Is maximalism a ploy to distract his subjects? Speculation abounds, but this reaction is nothing new. As long as portraits and images have existed, they've been created with purpose and symbolism, inviting controversy and trouble. The portrait j painted of Anne of Cleves purportedly helped convince Henry VIII of England to marry her, his fourth wife, on January 6, 1540.\u00a0 In 1539, Henry VIII dispatched an entourage to the Duchy of Cleves (in modern Germany) to meet with Anne's brother, Duke Willhelm. In need of a political ally, Henry was eager to marry Wilhelm's sister but wanted to see what his future bride looked like. Alongside the famous Holbein portrait, Henry's advisor Thomas Cromwell was told Anne was beautiful and the King was told she was ideal for bearing him more children given her \"convenient age, healthy temperament, elegant stature\u2026 and other graces.\"\u00a0 When Anne arrived in England, Henry was anything but pleased. \u00a0\"She is nothing fair. Her person is well and seemly, but nothing else,\" he said, apparently adding he wouldn't have married her at all had she not made the trip to England and if he didn't fear she would marry one of his enemies.\u00a0 While he did marry Anne, their marriage lasted only a few months. Because their marriage was never consummated, it was annulled on July 9, 1540.\u00a0 It's perhaps the most famous photo ever taken of Winston Churchill, and it\u2019s one that sparked the prime minister\u2019s anger. While Churchill was in Canada in 1941, photographer Yousuf Karsh was given one opportunity to take a picture of the British statesman.\u00a0 Ages 7-12 According to Karsh, \"Churchill\u2019s cigar was ever present. I held out an ashtray, but he would not dispose of it.\" Karsh walked back to his camera and waited for Churchill to take the cigar out of his mouth willingly. After several moments, Karsh, \"stepped toward him and, without premeditation, but ever so respectfully, I said, \u2018Forgive me, sir,\u2019 and plucked the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my camera, he looked so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph.\" The photo ultimately captured Churchill in a moment that defined him for the ages. It took a century to reveal the famed portrait of Abraham Lincoln from 1852 wasn't actually the 16th president of the United States. Amid modern discussions about photo manipulation\u00a0by artificial intelligence, the portrait of Lincoln offered perspective on how easily an image can be changed. Lincoln's head, as it turns out, was affixed to the body of John C. Calhoun, one of the biggest pro-slavery champions in mid-19th-century American politics. As Harold Holzer, co-author of The Lincoln Image: Abraham Lincoln and the Popular Print, explained, \"the John C. Calhoun portrait that morphed into a Lincoln portrait, flowing robes and all, Unionist replacing secessionist\" was among the many \"such prints [that] \u00a0elevated Lincoln to the status of American deity.\" While it's not as apparent in many of the portraits of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, as it is in those of his kinsmen, the Habsburg ruler did have the jaw for which his family is known: now known as prognathism, the lower jaw sticks out in an extreme underbite.\u00a0 Instead of highlighting what may have been an unpleasant physical feature (which has long been attributed to inbreeding), portraits of Leopold present him as somewhat glamorous and distinguished.\u00a0 There are distinct aspects of Leopold's appearance that are difficult not to notice. His big brown hair cascades down his shoulders, immediately leading the eye down to the mouth of the late 17th-century ruler. His plump, crimson lips in the portrait by Benjamin von Block are also set off by the red background and cape draping around him. Try as he might, von Block couldn't hide all of Leopold's features that earned him the surname \"Hogmouth.\" Using an image of a ruler for propaganda didn't start with Napoleon Bonaparte, but his artistic panegyrist, Jacques-Louis David, may have mastered the craft. His painting, five versions of which were made between 1801 and 1805, all feature Napoleon upon a noble steed in full general garb pointing up and onward. The cloak upon his shoulders changes from painting to painting, as does the color of the horse, but the glorification of the emperor as he crosses the Alps remains consistent.\u00a0 Napoleon Crossing the Alps drew upon artwork associated with the likes of Peter the Great, evoking his military prowess with one glance. Napoleon refused to pose for the portrait, telling David, \u00a0\"no one knows if portraits of great men are likenesses: it suffices that genius lives.\" In the end, Napoleon was right. The legacy of his achievements has undoubtedly mixed fact and myth, ultimately influenced by the work of artists like David.\u00a0 Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "Rise and Fall of the Mighty Minoans",
        "text": "Perhaps the inspiration for Atlantis, Minoan civilization born on the island of Crete spread throughout the Mediterranean before it mysteriously collapsed. In the epic poem The Odyssey, the Greek poet Homer praised an island that lies \u201cout in the wine-dark sea . . . a rich and lovely sea-girt land, densely peopled, with 90 cities and several different languages.\u201d This sophisticated place is not just a random spot in the Mediterranean\u2014Homer is describing Crete, southernmost of the Greek islands and home to one of the oldest civilizations in Europe. Located some 400 miles northwest of Alexandria in Egypt, Crete has been inhabited since the Neolithic period, around 7000 B.C. The culture that developed there during the second millennium B.C. spread throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean world. Crete\u2019s command of the seas would allow its stunning art and architecture to deeply influence the Mycenaean Greek civilization that would succeed it. Many myths and legends of Crete center around King Minos, son of the god Zeus and the Phoenician princess Europa. The thunder god had turned himself into a gentle, white bull. Charmed by the creature, Europa climbed on its back, and the bull bore her away to Crete where she would later bear their children. Minos became king of Crete and was said to be advised by Zeus himself. Under his rule, Minos built a strong navy and defeated rival city Athens. In one popular myth, Minos demands that Athens send 14 Athenian youths to Crete to be sacrificed to the fearsome Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull, who dwelled in the labyrinth on the island. These myths were created after Minoan civilization had declined, but still reflected the respect that later Greeks had for the people of Crete. Despite Minos\u2019s mythological status, the historian Thucydides\u2014working at the height of Athens\u2019s golden age in the fifth century B.C.\u2014wrote of him as if he were a historical figure, \u201cthe first to whom tradition ascribes the possession of a navy.\u201d Thucydides describes Minos as a conqueror: He expanded Cretan territories, taking the Cyclades\u2014the 30 or so islands that scatter the sea to the north of Crete\u2014expelling the native Carian peoples, and appointing his own sons to govern there. The historian also claims that, in order to \u201cprotect his growing revenues, [Minos] sought, as far as he was able, to clear the sea of pirates.\u201d Thucydides\u2019 vision of ancient Crete was a thalassocracy, from the Greek words thalassa, meaning \u201csea,\u201d and kratos, meaning \u201cpower.\u201d This notion may well reflect the historian\u2019s concerns with naval power in the region in his own day more than the reality of ancient Crete. Modern historians tend to view Crete as a less aggressive power that used its naval expertise to dominate trade rather than to conquer. Despite the importance of Crete to ancient Greek civilization, archaeological study of its culture is relatively recent. Some of the earliest traces of a powerful, Bronze Age civilization were uncovered in the 19th century. British archaeologist Arthur Evans discovered extensive ruins on Crete in the early 1900s. In honor of the legendary King Minos, he termed the civilization he uncovered \u201cMinoan.\u201d Archaeological evidence shows that during the third millennium B.C. Crete lay at the center of an extensive trading network dealing in copper from the Cyclades and tin from Asia Minor. These materials were essential for producing bronze, a commodity that brought power and prestige to the Minoans. In the second millennium B.C., great palaces began to be built on Crete during the period known as the Neopalatial (circa 1700-1490 B.C.). Evans excavated several of these structures, including the magnificent Palace of Knossos, seat of the legendary King Minos. More recent archaeological digs have demonstrated that Crete was widely urbanized during this period and that Knossos exercised some kind of hegemony over other Cretan cities. The mid-second millennium B.C. seemed a time of great prosperity. Although many Minoan structures have been given the secular term \u201cpalace,\u201d researchers believe their role was not a royal one. It has never been firmly established whether Minoan Crete had a true royal dynasty, so these lavish palaces may have had mixed secular and religious roles. Some archaeologists interpret these palaces more as civic centers from which to control and distribute raw materials, carry out rituals, mete out justice, maintain water distribution, and also organize festivals for the populace. Daily life was, for the majority, simple but comfortable. Islanders lived in houses made of stone, mud brick, and wood, and the domestic economy was based on viticulture and olive farming. The surrounding cypress forests provided timber for shipbuilding for the important Minoan fleet. As the Minoan upper classes grew increasing wealthy, they imported luxuries\u2014jewelry and precious stones\u2014which provided extra incentive to develop new trading routes for Crete\u2019s exports: timber, pottery, and textiles. Little evidence has been found of city walls or fortifications built on ancient Crete during this time. This finding seems to suggest that either there were no serious threats to the island or\u2014more likely\u2014that patrolling ships were enough to guard its coastlines. A maritime force would have also protected the trading routes, harbors, and strategic points, such as Amnisos, the port that served the capital, Knossos. Ages 7-12 As Minoan culture and trade radiated across the Aegean, communities on the islands of the Cyclades and the Dodecanese (near the coast of modern-day Turkey) were radically changed through contact with Crete. Cretan fashions became very popular in the eastern Mediterranean. Local island elites first acquired Cretan pottery and textiles as a symbol of prestige. Later, the presence of Minoan merchants also prompted island communities far from Knossos to adopt Crete\u2019s standard system of weights and measures. Perhaps the clearest sign of Minoan influence was the appearance of its writing system in the languages of later cultures. Characteristics of Crete\u2019s letters appear to have used several forms. One of the oldest was discovered by Arthur Evans and is now known as Linear A. Despite not yet being deciphered, scholars believe it is the local language of Minoan Crete. But it must have been an important regional common language of its day, as Linear A has been found inscribed on many of the clay vessels discovered on islands across the Aegean. The other script, called Linear B, evolved from Linear A. Deciphered in the 1950s, Linear B is recognized as the oldest known Greek dialect. The Minoans also maintained trading relationships with Egypt, Syria, and the Greek mainland. Their trade routes may have extended as far west as Italy and Sicily. Certain locations had especially close ties with Crete and its sailors. These included Miletus on the Anatolian peninsula on Crete\u2019s eastern trading route. The city of Akrotiri on the island of Thera (modern-day Santorini) is one of the best preserved of these Minoan settlements. A volcanic eruption around the 16th century B.C. buried Akrotiri under ash, preserving its ruins which were excavated in the 19th and 20th centuries. Digs in the 1960s and \u201970s unearthed a wealthy city with many distinctive Minoan features. Its walls boasted stunning murals of brightly colored, stylized images of sparring boxers, climbing monkeys, swimming dolphins, and flying birds. The quality of the paintings uncovered at Akrotiri suggests that artists either from Crete or influenced by its culture had set up workshops in this city. Other Aegean settlements bearing clear evidence of Minoan influence include the Cycladi islands of Melos and Kea, and islands in the Dodecanese, such as Rhodes. The settlement of Kastri, on the island of Cythera, south of the Peloponnesian peninsula of the Greek mainland, is another example of Cretan cultural power. Built to exploit the local stocks of murex\u2014a mollusk highly prized for its purple ink used for dyeing cloth\u2014Kastri is purely Minoan in its urban planning. But even this town was not a colony. There is no evidence that these places were politically subject to Crete, as it is not believed that they paid any kind of tribute beyond the money exchanged when trading goods. Minoan civilization declined by the late 15th century B.C., but the exact cause is unknown. One theory is that the volcanic eruption on Thera damaged other cities along Minoan trade routes, which hurt Crete economically. Taking all the evidence available, the volcano did not directly affect life on Crete\u2014about 70 miles to the south. No damage from the eruption has been found there. Four times more powerful than the devastating Krakatoa volcanic eruption of 1883, the volcano on Thera (modern-day Santorini) exploded around the 16th century B.C. It buried cities, killing thousands, and\u2014some say\u2014led to the collapse of Crete. Stories of the Minoan decline are believed to have morphed into the legend of Atlantis as described by the Greek philosopher Plato circa 360 B.C. Crete\u2019s cities seemed unaffected for at least a few generations after the volcano. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of an invasion in the mid-15th century B.C. Many sites, including several large palaces in central and southern Crete were burned, and many settlements were abandoned shortly thereafter. The invaders most likely overthrew the Minoan government and took control of the island, ending the era of Crete\u2019s dominance. Despite its abrupt ending, the influence of Crete survived. Its vibrant culture made a major impact on the rising new regional power: the Mycenaean Greeks, who lauded King Minos and Crete in their mythology. Linear B, the Cretan writing system adopted by the Mycenaeans, would be the basis for the Greek in which the poet Homer would write his two masterpieces.

In honor of the legendary King Minos, he termed the civilization he uncovered \u201cMinoan.\u201d\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that during the third millennium B.C. Crete lay at the center of an extensive trading network dealing in copper from the Cyclades and tin from Asia Minor. These materials were essential for producing bronze, a commodity that brought power and prestige to the Minoans. In the second millennium B.C., great palaces began to be built on Crete during the period known as the Neopalatial (circa 1700-1490 B.C.). Evans excavated several of these structures, including the magnificent Palace of Knossos, seat of the legendary King Minos.\n\nMore recent archaeological digs have demonstrated that Crete was widely urbanized during this period and that Knossos exercised some kind of hegemony over other Cretan cities. The mid-second millennium B.C. seemed a time of great prosperity. Although many Minoan structures have been given the secular term \u201cpalace,\u201d researchers believe their role was not a royal one. It has never been firmly established whether Minoan Crete had a true royal dynasty, so these lavish palaces may have had mixed secular and religious roles.\n\nSome archaeologists interpret these palaces more as civic centers from which to control and distribute raw materials, carry out rituals, mete out justice, maintain water distribution, and also organize festivals for the populace. Daily life was, for the majority, simple but comfortable. Islanders lived in houses made of stone, mud brick, and wood, and the domestic economy was based on viticulture and olive farming. The surrounding cypress forests provided timber for shipbuilding for the important Minoan fleet.\n\nAs the Minoan upper classes grew increasing wealthy, they imported luxuries\u2014jewelry and precious stones\u2014which provided extra incentive to develop new trading routes for Crete\u2019s exports: timber, pottery, and textiles. Little evidence has been found of city walls or fortifications built on ancient Crete during this time. This finding seems to suggest that either there were no serious threats to the island or\u2014more likely\u2014that patrolling ships were enough to guard its coastlines.\n\nA maritime force would have also protected the trading routes, harbors, and strategic points, such as Amnisos, the port that served the capital, Knossos. As Minoan culture and trade radiated across the Aegean, communities on the islands of the Cyclades and the Dodecanese (near the coast of modern-day Turkey) were radically changed through contact with Crete. Cretan fashions became very popular in the eastern Mediterranean. Local island elites first acquired Cretan pottery and textiles as a symbol of prestige.\n\nLater, the presence of Minoan merchants also prompted island communities far from Knossos to adopt Crete\u2019s standard system of weights and measures. Perhaps the clearest sign of Minoan influence was the appearance of its writing system in the languages of later cultures. Characteristics of Crete\u2019s letters appear to have used several forms. One of the oldest was discovered by Arthur Evans and is now known as Linear A. Despite not yet being deciphered, scholars believe it is the local language of Minoan Crete.\n\nBut it must have been an important regional common language of its day, as Linear A has been found inscribed on many of the clay vessels discovered on islands across the Aegean. The other script, called Linear B, evolved from Linear A. Deciphered in the 1950s, Linear B is recognized as the oldest known Greek dialect. The Minoans also maintained trading relationships with Egypt, Syria, and the Greek mainland. Their trade routes may have extended as far west as Italy and Sicily.\n\nCertain locations had especially close ties with Crete and its sailors. These included Miletus on the Anatolian peninsula on Crete\u2019s eastern trading route. The city of Akrotiri on the island of Thera (modern-day Santorini) is one of the best preserved of these Minoan settlements. A volcanic eruption around the 16th century B.C. buried Akrotiri under ash, preserving its ruins which were excavated in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDigs in the 1960s and \u201970s unearthed a wealthy city with many distinctive Minoan features. Its walls boasted stunning murals of brightly colored, stylized images of sparring boxers, climbing monkeys, swimming dolphins, and flying birds. The quality of the paintings uncovered at Akrotiri suggests that artists either from Crete or influenced by its culture had set up workshops in this city.\n\nOther Aegean settlements bearing clear evidence of Minoan influence include the Cycladi islands of Melos and Kea, and islands in the Dodecanese, such as Rhodes. The settlement of Kastri, on the island of Cythera, south of the Peloponnesian peninsula of the Greek mainland, is another example of Cretan cultural power. Built to exploit the local stocks of murex\u2014a mollusk highly prized for its purple ink used for dyeing cloth\u2014Kastri is purely Minoan in its urban planning.\n\nBut even this town was not a colony. There is no evidence that these places were politically subject to Crete, as it is not believed that they paid any kind of tribute beyond the money exchanged when trading goods. Minoan civilization declined by the late 15th century B.C., but the exact cause is unknown. One theory is that the volcanic eruption on Thera damaged other cities along Minoan trade routes, which hurt Crete economically.\n\nTaking all the evidence available, the volcano did not directly affect life on Crete\u2014about 70 miles to the south. No damage from the eruption has been found there. Four times more powerful than the devastating Krakatoa volcanic eruption of 1883, the volcano on Thera (modern-day Santorini) exploded around the 16th century B.C. It buried cities, killing thousands, and\u2014some say\u2014led to the collapse of Crete.\n\nStories of the Minoan decline are believed to have morphed into the legend of Atlantis as described by the Greek philosopher Plato circa 360 B.C. Crete\u2019s cities seemed unaffected for at least a few generations after the volcano. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of an invasion in the mid-15th century B.C. Many sites, including several large palaces in central and southern Crete were burned, and many settlements were abandoned shortly thereafter.\n\nThe invaders most likely overthrew the Minoan government and took control of the island, ending the era of Crete\u2019s dominance. Despite its abrupt ending, the influence of Crete survived. Its vibrant culture made a major impact on the rising new regional power: the Mycenaean Greeks, who lauded King Minos and Crete in their mythology. Linear B, the Cretan writing system adopted by the Mycenaeans, would be the basis for the Greek in which the poet Homer would write his two masterpieces."

        "title": "Aqueducts: Quenching Rome\u2019s Thirst",
        "text": "Ancient masters of engineering, aqueduct builders created a vast network of pipes, channels, and bridges to bring water to Rome, creating in the process an enduring symbol of Roman civilization and innovation. Rome is known for many things: its military conquests, its civic architecture, temples, roads, emperors, and sculpture. Yet none of these would have been possible without the most vital resource of all: water. Now, as then, water is life, and without effective distribution, there would have been no great Roman civilization. Even until relatively modern times, Roman techniques to collect, store, and channel water over huge distances remained unsurpassed. Such technology, was not, of course, invented from scratch by the Romans, and many earlier Mediterranean peoples had poured resources and expertise into managing water. On the island of Crete, the Minoans developed sophisticated rain-harvesting and filtering systems as early as the middle of the third millennium B.C. Cretan water management techniques were later adopted across the Greek-speaking world, and examples abound of tunnels, drainage systems, and cisterns, sometimes of considerable size. Yet although the water management tradition Rome inherited was rich and extensive, no previous system came close to the sophistication and reach of the Roman aqueduct. Striding across the landscape from Spain to Syria, these awe-inspiring structures not only carried life and livelihood but also proclaimed the greatness of Rome. 312 B.C.The censor Appius Claudius Caecus builds Rome\u2019s first aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, which runs almost entirely underground. 144 B.C.Work begins on Rome\u2019s longest aqueduct, the 56-mile-long Aqua Marcia. The city has doubled in size since the last channel was built. 33 B.C.After the chaotic civil wars Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) improves Rome\u2019s water by building the Aqua Julia. 19 B.C.Marcus Agrippa, Augustus\u2019s son-in-law, oversees the building of the Aqua Virgo to supply the thermal baths in the Campus Martius. A.D. 38-52Caligula begins a new aqueduct to meet increased demand from baths. Claudius nishes the work and calls it Aqua Claudia. A.D. 109Trajan builds the Aqua Traiana, which brings water from near Lake Bracciano to supply Rome\u2019s new suburbs, known today as Trastevere. Aqueducts were costly public works, and not all Roman cities necessarily required them. Some cities, such as Pompeii, had their water needs met by wells or public and private cisterns dug beneath houses. Some cisterns could reach a colossal size, such as the Basilica Cistern (Yerebatan Sarn\u0131c\u0131) in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) and the Piscina Mirabilis in Miseno, Italy. The latter, built to provide drinking water to the Roman navy in the Bay of Naples, had a capacity of just under half a million cubic feet. Its colossal vault is held up by 48 pillars. Some cities needed much more water than cisterns could provide. Booming populations such as Rome\u2019s\u2014thought to have reached one million in the first century A.D.\u2014needed an entire system of aqueducts not only for drinking water but also for supplying ornamental public fountains and baths. The popular image many people have of an aqueduct is probably something like the spectacular bridge structure of the Pont du Gard in southern France. These aboveground arches were, in fact, only a small section of an aqueduct system. Roman engineers would create a gentle downward slope all the way from start to finish, since the only force powering the water\u2019s progress was gravity. Only valleys or gullies necessitated a monumental arched structure. For most of its route, water ran along underground or ground-level channels. Rome, for example, was supplied by aqueducts totaling 315 miles in length. Of that, 269 miles ran underground and 46 total miles aboveground; however, only about 36 miles consisted of arched structures\u2014just under 12 percent in all. Most of an aqueduct\u2019s course lay underground, along channels that required huge resources and manpower to build. Once the route had been designed, a series of shafts (putei) were dug at intervals of around 230 feet following an ancient Persian technique known as qanat. When the planned depth was reached, construction of the channel or specus began. The shafts were used to carry away dirt in baskets and send down building materials. A crane was used to lower stone blocks, which may have been brought from a nearby quarry, to form the lining for the tunnel walls. Depending on the local availability of materials, bricks or concrete were sometimes used for this purpose. The channel was usually waterproofed with a layer of opus signinum, a kind of mortar made of fragments of crushed tiles and amphorae. Roman piping systems carried water from sources to the city for dozens of miles. The route had to gently slope to allow gravity to carry the water to its destination. Engineers followed the land\u2019s natural grade wherever possible, building channels underground\u2014even if that meant having to make long detours. The Aqua Traiana was a total of 37 miles long, but the distance, as the crow flies, between the spring and Rome was about 31 miles. Only when they had no other choice\u2014when they had to cross a valley or avoid a sudden drop\u2014did they build the spectacular archways, sometimes several stories tall, that dominate the Mediterranean landscape. 1. Materials: Basic Roman construction materials were stone blocks, concrete, mortar, tiles, and bricks. The structure was faced with a mix of lime and crushed ceramic. 2. Scaffolding: As the construction process advanced, wooden scaffolding was built to aid the workmen, many of whom would have been slaves. 3. Centering: This wooden structure bore the arch\u2019s weight until the last stone was laid. When it was removed, the slotted stones could support their own weight. 4. Arches: Bridges could have two or\u2014less commonly\u2014as many as three tiers of arches. Roman engineers opted for narrow arches, which provided maximum strength. 5. Pillars: Massive pillars, measuring around 10 feet by 10 feet, were required to bear the weight of the arch tiers, and were usually longer at the base of the structure. 6. Specus: The specus, or water channel, was on the top level of the viaduct and covered with a roof or vault. Sometimes two or more channels were laid on top of one another. Rome had as many as 11 aqueduct systems, the most ancient of which was the mile-long Aqua Appia, first operational in 312 B.C. It was named for its sponsor, the censor Appius Claudius Caecus, better known for another great pioneering structure of ancient Rome: the Appian Way, one of the first major Roman roads. Three more aqueducts were built in the third and second centuries B.C.: Aqua Anio Vetus, Aqua Marcia, and Aqua Tepula. Aided by his son-in-law Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Emperor Augustus was particularly active in improving the capital\u2019s water supply, repairing old systems and building new ones. The Augustan-era Aqua Virgo\u2014named, according to legend, for the young girl who directed thirsty soldiers to the springs that fed it\u2014has been used uninterrupted ever since its construction. During his reign, Caligula began building two aqueducts that were finished by Emperor Claudius, the Aqua Claudia and Aqua Anio Novus. Trajan built the Aqua Traiana, which is 37 miles long, in A.D. 109. The last of Rome\u2019s aqueducts was the Aqua Alexandrina, nearly 14 miles long, built by Alexander Severus in A.D. 226. Some have calculated that, once completed, Rome\u2019s aqueducts delivered roughly 1.5 million cubic yards of water per day\u2014about 200 gallons per person. Its water network supplied 11 grand-scale baths, as well as the 900 or so public baths, and almost 1,400 monumental fountains and private swimming pools. Ages 7-12 A crucial later stage in the conveying of water was, of course, its disposal. Rome\u2019s Cloaca Maxima sewer, which flowed into the Tiber River, became the model for urban sanitation. By the time Pliny the Elder was writing in the first century A.D., the Cloaca was already ancient: \u201c[F]or 700 years from the time of Tarquinius Priscus, the sewers have survived almost completely intact,\u201d he notes admiringly in his encyclopedia Naturalis historia. The only Roman aqueduct still functioning today is the Aqua Virgo, known in Italian as Acqua Vergine. Built in 19 B.C. to a plan by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa during the boom in hydrology projects ordered by Augustus, its survival to the present day is a remarkable example of how ancient infrastructure can evolve to meet the needs of different ages. The popes restored it several times in the Christian era: Adrian I, in the eighth century; Nicholas V in the 15th century (he is responsible for installing the vertiginous spiral staircase that makes it possible to climb inside); and Pius V in the 16th century. Concrete structures have been added in more recent times and urban growth has, unfortunately, polluted water that was once highly prized for its purity. Today it is used for irrigation and to supply some of the most beautiful fountains in Rome. From planning to completion, building an aqueduct was an extremely costly enterprise, a project for which many Roman cities proudly raised funds. Evidence shows that money often came from both public and private sources. Sometimes aqueducts were paid for by leading citizens. The work was usually carried out as part of their political role. For example, as aedile and consul, Augustus\u2019 son-in-law Agrippa used his own mines to produce the lead pipes that lined the Aqua Julia and Aqua Virgo. From Augustus\u2019 time onward, emperors regularly made donations to the upkeep of this expensive infrastructure. Among the very few sources to shed light on how aqueducts were built is a Roman funerary monument found at the city of Bejai\u0308a in Algeria. This commemorates the life of one Nonius Datus, an engineer, and recounts the difficulties he encountered in carrying out his work. The long text, written after the aqueduct\u2019s completion around A.D. 152, describes how the city\u2019s inhabitants lobbied for an improved water supply. The process was not as speedy as might have been hoped. Datus planned the aqueduct\u2019s route in around 138. However, the work was not completed until 152, following a series of setbacks, which the monument describes in detail. Most crucially, the teams of workmen who started excavating the two sides of the tunnel did not meet where they were supposed to. On another occasion, bandits attacked the site and Datus escaped by the skin of his teeth, naked, battered, and bruised. The Roman administration expended huge efforts not just in conveying water, but in maintaining its purity. A large group of specialized workers known as aquarii, ensured the aqueducts\u2019 proper operation and cleanliness. These technicians carried out repairs and systematically cleaned the channels to prevent blockages and maintain a decent water quality. The channel along which the water flowed was always kept covered and tanks called piscinae limariae were placed along the route into which impurities were regularly decanted.     One of Roman Spain\u2019s most iconic monuments, the Segovia aqueduct is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and one of the best preserved Roman aqueducts in the world. Built to carry water from the Fri\u0301o River 10 miles away, the structure was traditionally attributed to the emperor Augustus. Recent studies have shown it dates from the period of the emperor Trajan in the first part of the second century A.D. Known by Segovians as El Puente (\u201cthe bridge\u201d), the aqueduct features 168 arches. In recent years basins have been found alongside the channel, originally built to filter out the sand carried along from its source. Unlike other aqueduct bridges, plundered for their stone, the Segovia structure has been in almost constant use since its construction, ensuring it has survived intact for nearly 2,000 years.      Even for Romans, private access to water came at a price. Homeowners who could afford running water paid for the service based on the diameter of their access pipe, a not entirely foolproof billing system. There are records of homeowners slyly installing wider pipes than those for which they paid. This scam led to the invention of the calix, a sleeved pipe fitted into the wall, which was decorated to prevent forgeries or alterations. They were also used in the castella aquarum, the tanks from which water was distributed to different parts of the city. Despite regulation, some Romans tried to steal water from the source and would drain off water from the aqueduct or bribe the aquarii to do so. In the first century A.D. the senator Sextus Julius Frontinus mentioned this practice in his treatise De aquaeductu as \u201cfraus aquariorum\u201d: plumbing fraud. To such a practical people as the Romans, aqueducts were a source of great pride and even part of their identity. Frontinus made that clear in his treatise on these great public works. \u201cWith such an array of indispensable structures carrying so much water, compare, if you will, the idle Pyramids or the useless, though famous, works of the Greeks!\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright \u00a9 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The effect is as sudden as it is overwhelming. It shuts out the sky and the horizon. It shuts out all the other Pyramids. It shuts out everything but the sense of awe and wonder.\u201d Most modern travelers would probably reach for similar words to pinpoint the sublime thrill of seeing the Pyramids at Giza in person today. They are so iconic, so astonishingly ancient, that it is hard to imagine that 4,600 years ago the plateau where they stand was a desolate, dune-covered wilderness where a scattering of tombs lay under the burning Egyptian sun. Along with the enigmatic Sphinx and other smaller tombs and monuments, Giza has three principal pyramids: Khufu (originally 481 feet high, and sometimes called Cheops, or the Great Pyramid); Khafre (471 feet); and Menkaure (213 feet). Emerging out of the complex dynastic needs of Egypt\u2019s 4th dynasty, they are the triumphant product of one of the most daring and innovative engineering projects the world has ever known. The kings of the 4th dynasty ruled Egypt from around 2575 to 2465 B.C. Presiding over the golden age of the Old Kingdom, their center of power was the sophisticated Nile-side city of Memphis, about 15 miles south of Giza. The dynasty\u2019s second king, Khufu, ruled during a period of relative peace in Egypt, although the Greek historian Herodotus later depicted him and his son as cruel and proud. Khufu\u2019s architects and engineers embarked on a project that transcends any other structure in the Bronze Age. Its completion utterly transformed the plateau. Khufu had selected it, in part, to distance himself from the magnificent pyramids built by his father, Snefru, in Dahshur, another necropolis near Memphis. Several other factors also made it an ideal site. The high plateau allowed greater visibility for the pyramid. It was near Heliopolis, basis of the cult of the sun god Re. Since there were already some tombs in Giza, the land had already been sanctified and so was fit for a pharaoh\u2019s tomb of a stature never seen before, or surpassed since. After Khufu\u2019s death, his son Redjedef ruled for a short time and began work on a tomb in Abu Ruwaysh that was never finished. The next pharaoh, his brother Khafre, built a pyramid\u2014as well as the Great Sphinx, some scholars claim\u2014in Giza. The next generation followed the same pattern: Baufre, son of Redjedef, built his tomb outside of Giza, while Menkaure, Khafre\u2019s son, built his in Giza. Each pharaoh who built in Giza did so in accordance with some simple rules that harmoniously ordered the three funerary complexes on the plateau: the facade of Khafre\u2019s high temple is aligned with the western face of Khufu\u2019s pyramid. And the facade of Menkaure\u2019s high temple is aligned with the western face of Khafre\u2019s pyramid. At the same time, the imaginary line that roughly joins the southeast corners of the three pyramids points toward the temple of Re in Heliopolis. circa 2550 B.C. Khufu, second king of Egypt\u2019s 4th dynasty, begins work on his pyramid. When complete, the massive tomb will measure 481 feet high, the biggest pyramid ever. circa 2530 B.C.Redjedef, Khufu\u2019s son, holds power for only a few years. He commissions a pyramid north of Giza at Abu Ruwaysh, but the structure is never finished. circa 2520 B.C.Khafre, another son of Khufu, commissions the second pyramid at Giza. Although it is slightly smaller than Khufu\u2019s, it sits on higher ground, making it look taller. circa 2490 B.C.Menkaure, after succeeding his father, places his pyramid next to Khafre\u2019s and his grandfather\u2019s. The contents of all three tombs will be looted. Herodotus claimed that construction of the Great Pyramid\u2014today calculated at over six million tons of stone\u2014was carried out using slave labor. It is now known this building was undertaken, in fact, by paid Egyptian laborers. The notion that Egyptian monuments were built by slaves\u2014such as the plight of the Hebrew slaves recounted in the biblical book of Exodus\u2014seems to have had currency in the ancient world. Ages 7-12 Such colossal building projects would have left some kind of archaeological trace, and so it was amid huge excitement that in 1999 archaeologists started to uncover the village housing of the workmen who built the two later pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure. This followed the discovery of the workers\u2019 cemetery in 1990, which was divided into upper and lower parts according to the rank of the deceased. Imhotep was one of the leading minds of the 3rd dynasty, not only because he was the architect of the first pyramid to be built, the Saqqara step pyramid, but because he held senior positions in all areas of Egyptian society: religious, political, economic, and artistic. He also built the pyramid of Djoser\u2019s successor, Sekhemkhet. He was later deified as the god of medicine throughout Egypt in the Late Period. Both village and cemetery offer archaeologists a mine of valuable data about the conditions in which the two smaller pyramids of Giza were built\u2014data that, in turn, gives a working hypothesis as to the construction of the pyramid of Khufu. A study of workers\u2019 bones shows that the work was backbreaking\u2014sometimes literally. Yet these laborers, far from being slaves, were privileged civil servants, and beneficiaries of a number of enviable perks. Analyses show they enjoyed a protein-rich diet, practically unheard of among the rest of the Nile Valley\u2019s inhabitants. Evidence that broken limbs and fractures had been set correctly strongly suggests adequate medical care was provided. One of the skeletons in the cemetery had a leg amputated so precisely that experts estimate that the patient lived for some 20 years after the operation. The discovery of the workers\u2019 village has also enabled archaeologists to debunk another of Herodotus\u2019s somewhat fanciful claims: that 100,000 people built Khufu\u2019s pyramid. In fact, the village seems to have had a maximum capacity of 20,000 people, of whom perhaps half were dedicated to construction at any one time. The daunting challenges of building such a structure, and efficiently marshaling thousands of workers, required meticulous planning. Scribes set about calculating the number of blocks that would be required to build a pyramid with the selected gradient\u2014in the case of Khufu, the angle of the sides with the ground is 52 degrees\u2014the kind of mathematical problem recorded in Egyptian mathematical papyri, and at which Egyptian civil servants excelled. Graffiti and inscriptions at the site have also enabled scholars to piece together telling facts about life on this colossal construction site. Blocks found with dates from all seasons in the Egyptian calendar suggest the pyramids were built year-round and not just when the Nile was in flood. It is not known who designed the Great Pyramid, but the man responsible for supervising its complex construction was Hemiunu, Khufu\u2019s nephew, a senior civil servant who acted as the pharaoh\u2019s vizier. Despite the mystery surrounding Giza, Hemiunu himself was a flesh-and-blood man, as shown by his decidedly lifelike\u2014and fleshy\u2014statue, found in his tomb in Giza\u2019s west cemetery. There are many types of pyramids and not all were built in the same way. The lowest stones in Egypt\u2019s first ever pyramid\u2014Djoser\u2019s step pyramid in Saqqara, built the century before Khufu\u2019s\u2014are bricks. But as construction progressed, and engineers became more confident, they used larger blocks. The largest at Giza, weighing three tons, were those used to build Khafre\u2019s pyramid. Much of the stonework in the Giza Pyramids came from a quarry barely half a mile to the south of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. The white limestone that once formed the outer casing had a longer journey to Giza, moved by boat along the Nile from Tura, eight miles away. When he was working in Karnak in the 1930s, the scholar Henri Chevrier discovered that a five-ton block can be dragged horizontally along a wet clay track by just six men. As pictures found in tombs have shown, blocks of that size were also sometimes pulled by oxen. The ramps by which they were raised onto the pyramid structure have also been depicted on the decoration of some tombs, and there is archaeological evidence for such ramps at Giza itself. The geometry of a pyramid helped overcome the logistical problem of raising massive stones: As much as 40 percent of a pyramid\u2019s volume is concentrated in its bottom third. The raising of stone blocks by means of a ramp beyond the lower third of the structure was, however, a major challenge, and it is still not fully known how the Egyptians solved the problem. One solution would have been to use the building\u2019s inner step structure\u2014visible today, since the outer casing stones have long disappeared\u2014because then the blocks would only have had to be raised a little at a time, in the same way a heavy object can be eased up a staircase. The rows making up Khufu\u2019s pyramid are slightly more than two feet high on average. So it is highly likely that, given sufficient manpower, levers could be used to raise large blocks into position\u2014and so on, until the construction reached completion in the form of the pinnacle, known as the pyramidion, which historians believe was put in place in the course of a solemn ceremony. The pyramidion atop Khufu has long been toppled, but is thought to have been of white Tura stone. It capped a total of two and a half million stone blocks, making it one of the most massive buildings on the planet, the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing. He ordered the building of one of the biggest monuments in the world, one which bears his name 4,500 years after he ruled. His name appears on documents and on the few reliefs that remain on the entrance path to his funerary complex. Yet until a few years ago, there was only one tiny representation of Khufu, the man who built the Great Pyramid of Giza: an ivory carving just three inches high (above), an artifact considered\u2014in a supremely ironic twist\u2014as the smallest piece of Egyptian royal sculpture ever discovered. Recently, however, some specialists have suggested that a pair of limestone and granite stone heads from the Old Kingdom might be portraits of Khufu\u2014a theory contested by other historians. Yet another hypothesis may give Khufu the biggest boost of all: According to Giza expert Rainer Stadelmann, the face of the Great Sphinx at Giza is not Khafre\u2014as some scholars have argued\u2014but Khufu himself, in divine form, protecting his pyramid.

        "title": "Beautiful Babylon: Jewel of the Ancient World",
        "text": "Ruled by Hammurabi, restored by Nebuchadrezzar, conquered by Cyrus\u2014this city in the heart of Mesopotamia was both desired and despised, placing it at the center stage of the dawn of history. Mesopotamia\u2014\u201cthe land between two rivers\u201d\u2014gave birth to many of the world\u2019s first great cities. The splendid city of Babylon, located between the waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris some 60 miles south of Baghdad, was one of them. Unlike the many towns that fell and disappeared, Babylon was resilient, rising from its own ashes time and again, even as new conquerors invaded and took over. The pleasure its occupiers enjoyed came at a price, however, since the highly desired Babylon would always be seen as a prize for the taking. Babylon has resonated in Judeo-Christian culture for centuries. The books of the Old Testament recount the exile of the Jews to Babylon following the sack of Jerusalem, by whose waters they \u201csat down and wept.\u201d By the time of the New Testament, the city had become a potent symbol: the corrupt earthly twin city to the pure, heavenly New Jerusalem. Outside the biblical tradition, Babylon intrigued Greek and Roman writers, who added to the rich store of legends that have come down to the present day. The Greek historian Herodotus wrote about Babylon in the fifth century B.C. A number of inconsistencies in his account have led many scholars to believe that he never traveled there and that his text may be closer to hearsay than historical fact. Popular tales of Babylon\u2019s fantastic structures, like the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens, may also be products of legends and confusion. Yet to historians and archaeologists, Babylon is a real bricks-and-mortar place at the center of the vibrant Mesopotamian culture that it dominated for so many centuries. 19th-16th centuries B.C.The Amorites, including King Hammurabi, reign. The Hittites later conquer the city. 16th-11th centuries B.C.The Kassites conquer Babylon. Later, Chaldeans and Aramaeans struggle to control the city. 11th-7th centuries B.C.A period of Assyrian rule is ended by the Chaldeans, who will flourish under Nebuchadrezzar II. 7th-6th centuries B.C.Babylon\u2019s golden age under Chaldean rule is ended by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 539 B.C. To the 7th century A.D.Macedonians, Seleucids, and Sasanians control Babylon until the arrival of Islam. The site of Babylon was first identified in the 1800s in what is now Iraq. Later excavations, undertaken by the German archaeologist Robert Koldewey in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, established that the city had been built and rebuilt several times, most notably on a lavish scale by its king, Nebuchadrezzar II (reigned 605-561 B.C.). Koldewey\u2019s finds revealed an ancient locus of culture and political power. These excavations unearthed what was to become one of the most magnificent Babylonian landmarks built by Nebuchadrezzar II: the dazzling blue Ishtar Gate, now reconstructed and on display at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. Babylon first rose to prominence in the late Bronze Age, around the beginning of the second millennium B.C., when it was occupied by people known as the Amorites. A series of strong Amorite kings\u2014including King Hammurabi, famous for compiling the world\u2019s first legal code\u2014enabled Babylon to eclipse the Sumerian capital, Ur, as the region\u2019s most powerful city. Although Babylon declined after Hammurabi\u2019s death, its importance as the capital of southern Mesopotamia, now known as Babylonia, would linger for millennia. For the rest of the second millennium B.C., constant struggles popped up over control of Babylon. It was successively occupied by Hittites and Kassites; later, Chaldean tribesmen fought for dominance with another tribe, the Aramaeans from Syria (a tribe that had also sparred with Israel). By 1000 B.C., the Assyrians, who had established a powerful empire in northern Mesopotamia, gained the upper hand. But despite periods of stable rule, Babylon would always fall to someone else. Given this pattern of constant conquest\u2014Cyrus the Great in the sixth century B.C., and Alexander the Great two hundred years later\u2014it is perhaps more helpful to see the city not as one Babylon, but as several Babylons, the product of traditions built over thousands of years. The Babylonians themselves were keenly aware of the great antiquity of their civilization. One of Nebuchadrezzar\u2019s successors, Nabonidus, is now known to modern historians as \u201cthe archaeologist king.\u201d A learned man, he restored the region\u2019s ancient architectural and cultural traditions, especially those from the Akkadian Empire, which had dominated Mesopotamia in the third millennium B.C.\u2014a period that, from the perspective of his own era, would have already seemed in the distant past. Babylon enjoyed its heyday during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., when it was believed to be the largest city in the world. A new dynasty founded by a tribe known as the Chaldeans had wrested control from the Assyrians in the early 600s B.C. The second ruler of the Chaldean line became notorious for both cruelty and opulence: Nebuchadrezzar II, the king who sacked Jerusalem and sent the captive Jews to the capital of his new and increasingly powerful regional empire. Ages 7-12 A successful military man, Nebuchadrezzar used the wealth he garnered from other lands to rebuild and glorify Babylon. He completed and strengthened the city\u2019s defenses, including digging a moat and building new city walls. Beautification projects were on the agenda as well. The grand Processional Way was paved with limestone, temples were renovated and rebuilt, and the glorious Ishtar Gate was erected. Constructed of glazed cobalt blue bricks and embellished with bulls and dragons, the city gate features an inscription, attributed to Nebuchadrezzar, that says: \u201cI placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendor so that people might gaze on them in wonder.\u201d Babylonian citizens saw their city as a paradise\u2014the center of the world and symbol of cosmic harmony that had come into existence when its supreme divinity, the god Marduk, defeated the forces of chaos. The spread of the cult of Marduk across Mesopotamia was proof of Babylon\u2019s prestige. No ancient city was so desired and feared, so admired and denigrated. But in the Hebrew tradition, Nebuchadrezzar was a tyrant, and Babylon a torment. The king had conquered Jerusalem in the early sixth century B.C. and exiled the Hebrews to Babylon. The Bible says that he also stole sacred objects from the Jewish temple and took them back to Babylon to place in the temple of Marduk. To punish his disrespect, the Bible recounts in the Book of Daniel how Nebuchadrezzar\u2019s line will fall. In the story, Belshazzar, the successor to the throne, holds a feast served on the sacred vessels looted from Jerusalem. During the festivities a ghostly hand appears, and strange writing appears on the wall, forming the mysterious words: Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. The exile Daniel is brought in by the terrified king to interpret the writing on the wall. Daniel reads it as: \u201cGod has numbered the days of your kingdom ... [it] is given to the Medes and Persians.\u201d Daniel\u2019s prediction did come to pass: In 539 B.C., Babylon fell to the Persian king Cyrus the Great, and the Jews returned home from exile. The city would be conquered two centuries later by Alexander the Great in 331. Although Alexander had planned to make Babylon the capital of his empire, he died before that came to pass. The great city would eventually be abandoned by his successors, and the splendors of Babylon would pass into the realm of legend. One of the most famous stories about Babylon is that of the Tower of Babel, a story that some biblical scholars believe may be based on a mistranslation, or ingenious pun. The Book of Genesis tells how the survivors of the Great Flood wanted to build a tower that would reach the heavens, but God smites the builders for their arrogance and disperses them over the Earth, where they are forced to speak many different languages. The story originates in a Hebrew belief that the name Babel was formed from the Hebrew word meaning confusion, or mixing up (and from which the English word \u201cbabble\u201d is derived). Ironically, this interpretation was itself a confusing of languages. In Akkadian, the root of the words Babylon and Babel does not mean to mix; it means \u201cgateway of the gods.\u201d Archaeologists believe that the tower referenced in the Bible story may be the Etemenanki, a giant ziggurat in Babylon dedicated to Marduk. Its name means, suggestively, the \u201ctemple of the foundation of heaven and earth,\u201d which dovetails with the names mentioned in the story. When it was surveyed in 1913, the Etemenanki revealed that the tower that supposedly reached right up to the heavens would have been, in reality, nearer 200 feet in height. Another colorful story to come out of the ancient city is that of the fabulous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. There are many theories surrounding the gardens, from their exact location to the identities of their builders. Some suggest the gardens formed a part of the royal palace in Babylon itself, while others believe they were built in another city altogether. One origin story claims that Nebuchadrezzar had them built for his wife, Amytis. In the course of Koldewey\u2019s excavations of the ancient city, his team identified a mysterious structure in one corner of Babylon\u2019s southern palace. It was made of 14 long rooms with vaulted ceilings laid out in two rows. A complex of wells and channels were found at the site. Even amid the academic atmosphere of this project, a certain willingness to believe in Babylon\u2019s fantastic stories lingered. Was this the infrastructure that supplied the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon? The scholarly consensus has a rather more prosaic theory as to this structure\u2019s role: a storehouse used for the distribution of sesame oil, grain, dates, and spices. So where in the city could those famous gardens have been? Perhaps nowhere at all. There is no text from Nebuchadrezzar II\u2019s time that refers to the building of any such gardens. The Greek historian Herodotus did not mention them, either. The only written references come much later, from scholars such as Diodorus Siculus, Quintus Curtius, Strabo, and Flavius Josephus, all writing at a time after Babylon had been abandoned. It is, perhaps, little surprise that so much confusion surrounds Babylon when texts by Greek and Roman authors often confused Assyrians with Babylonians. When the first-century B.C. writer Diodorus Siculus describes the walls of Babylon, he actually appears to be describing the walls of Nineveh, capital of the Assyrian Empire. He describes a hunting scene that resembles no artwork found on the palaces in Babylon. It does, however, fit descriptions of the hunting reliefs discovered on Assyrian palaces in Nineveh. This confusion may be due, in part, to the fact that some kings of Assyria, such as Sennacherib (reigned 704-681 B.C.), held the title of king of Babylon. More intriguingly still, a depiction of that Assyrian king found on a bas relief in Nineveh shows leafy gardens watered by an aqueduct. Could it be, then, that the famous gardens were in Nineveh all along? Inconvenient historical realities have never discouraged rulers from reshaping the history of Babylon in their own image and generating new myths in the process. One of the most brazen examples is not from antiquity, but from the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein\u2014then dictator of Iraq\u2014set out to create a reconstruction of its royal palace. Like his predecessors, he left behind inscriptions on his building projects. On some of the bricks Hussein had inscribed in Arabic: Built by Saddam, son of Nebuchadrezzar, to glorify Iraq.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nMesopotamia\u2014\u201cthe land between two rivers\u201d\u2014gave birth to many of the world\u2019s first great cities. The splendid city of Babylon, located between the waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris some 60 miles south of Baghdad, was one of them. Unlike the many towns that fell and disappeared, Babylon was resilient, rising from its own ashes time and again, even as new conquerors invaded and took over. The pleasure its occupiers enjoyed came at a price, however, since the highly desired Babylon would always be seen as a prize for the taking.\n\nBabylon has resonated in Judeo-Christian culture for centuries. The books of the Old Testament recount the exile of the Jews to Babylon following the sack of Jerusalem, by whose waters they \u201csat down and wept.\u201d By the time of the New Testament, the city had become a potent symbol: the corrupt earthly twin city to the pure, heavenly New Jerusalem. Outside the biblical tradition, Babylon intrigued Greek and Roman writers, who added to the rich store of legends that have come down to the present day.\n\nThe Greek historian Herodotus wrote about Babylon in the fifth century B.C. A number of inconsistencies in his account have led many scholars to believe that he never traveled there and that his text may be closer to hearsay than historical fact. Popular tales of Babylon\u2019s fantastic structures, like the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens, may also be products of legends and confusion. Yet to historians and archaeologists, Babylon is a real bricks-and-mortar place at the center of the vibrant Mesopotamian culture that it dominated for so many centuries.\n\n19th-16th centuries B.C.The Amorites, including King Hammurabi, reign. The Hittites later conquer the city. 16th-11th centuries B.C.The Kassites conquer Babylon. Later, Chaldeans and Aramaeans struggle to control the city. 11th-7th centuries B.C.A period of Assyrian rule is ended by the Chaldeans, who will flourish under Nebuchadrezzar II. 7th-6th centuries B.C.Babylon\u2019s golden age under Chaldean rule is ended by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 539 B.C. To the 7th century A.D.Macedonians, Seleucids, and Sasanians control Babylon until the arrival of Islam.\n\nThe site of Babylon was first identified in the 1800s in what is now Iraq. Later excavations, undertaken by the German archaeologist Robert Koldewey in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, established that the city had been built and rebuilt several times, most notably on a lavish scale by its king, Nebuchadrezzar II (reigned 605-561 B.C.). Koldewey\u2019s finds revealed an ancient locus of culture and political power. These excavations unearthed what was to become one of the most magnificent Babylonian landmarks built by Nebuchadrezzar II: the dazzling blue Ishtar Gate, now reconstructed and on display at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\n\nBabylon first rose to prominence in the late Bronze Age, around the beginning of the second millennium B.C., when it was occupied by people known as the Amorites. A series of strong Amorite kings\u2014including King Hammurabi, famous for compiling the world\u2019s first legal code\u2014enabled Babylon to eclipse the Sumerian capital, Ur, as the region\u2019s most powerful city. Although Babylon declined after Hammurabi\u2019s death, its importance as the capital of southern Mesopotamia, now known as Babylonia, would linger for millennia.\n\nFor the rest of the second millennium B.C., constant struggles popped up over control of Babylon. It was successively occupied by Hittites and Kassites; later, Chaldean tribesmen fought for dominance with another tribe, the Aramaeans from Syria (a tribe that had also sparred with Israel). By 1000 B.C., the Assyrians, who had established a powerful empire in northern Mesopotamia, gained the upper hand. But despite periods of stable rule, Babylon would always fall to someone else.\n\nGiven this pattern of constant conquest\u2014Cyrus the Great in the sixth century B.C., and Alexander the Great two hundred years later\u2014it is perhaps more helpful to see the city not as one Babylon, but as several Babylons, the product of traditions built over thousands of years. The Babylonians themselves were keenly aware of the great antiquity of their civilization. One of Nebuchadrezzar\u2019s successors, Nabonidus, is now known to modern historians as \u201cthe archaeologist king.\u201d A learned man, he restored the region\u2019s ancient architectural and cultural traditions, especially those from the Akkadian Empire, which had dominated Mesopotamia in the third millennium B.C.\u2014a period that, from the perspective of his own era, would have already seemed in the distant past.\n\nBabylon enjoyed its heyday during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., when it was believed to be the largest city in the world. A new dynasty founded by a tribe known as the Chaldeans had wrested control from the Assyrians in the early 600s B.C. The second ruler of the Chaldean line became notorious for both cruelty and opulence: Nebuchadrezzar II, the king who sacked Jerusalem and sent the captive Jews to the capital of his new and increasingly powerful regional empire.\n\nA successful military man, Nebuchadrezzar used the wealth he garnered from other lands to rebuild and glorify Babylon. He completed and strengthened the city\u2019s defenses, including digging a moat and building new city walls. Beautification projects were on the agenda as well. The grand Processional Way was paved with limestone, temples were renovated and rebuilt, and the glorious Ishtar Gate was erected. Constructed of glazed cobalt blue bricks and embellished with bulls and dragons, the city gate features an inscription, attributed to Nebuchadrezzar, that says: \u201cI placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendor so that people might gaze on them in wonder.\u201d\n\nBabylonian citizens saw their city as a paradise\u2014the center of the world and symbol of cosmic harmony that had come into existence when its supreme divinity, the god Marduk, defeated the forces of chaos. The spread of the cult of Marduk across Mesopotamia was proof of Babylon\u2019s prestige. No ancient city was so desired and feared, so admired and denigrated. But in the Hebrew tradition, Nebuchadrezzar was a tyrant, and Babylon a torment. The king had conquered Jerusalem in the early sixth century B.C. and exiled the Hebrews to Babylon. The Bible says that he also stole sacred objects from the Jewish temple and took them back to Babylon to place in the temple of Marduk.\n\nTo punish his disrespect, the Bible recounts in the Book of Daniel how Nebuchadrezzar\u2019s line will fall. In the story, Belshazzar, the successor to the throne, holds a feast served on the sacred vessels looted from Jerusalem. During the festivities a ghostly hand appears, and strange writing appears on the wall, forming the mysterious words: Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. The exile Daniel is brought in by the terrified king to interpret the writing on the wall. Daniel reads it as: \u201cGod has numbered the days of your kingdom ... [it] is given to the Medes and Persians.\u201d Daniel\u2019s prediction did come to pass: In 539 B.C., Babylon fell to the Persian king Cyrus the Great, and the Jews returned home from exile.\n\nThe city would be conquered two centuries later by Alexander the Great in 331. Although Alexander had planned to make Babylon the capital of his empire, he died before that came to pass. The great city would eventually be abandoned by his successors, and the splendors of Babylon would pass into the realm of legend.\n\nOne of the most famous stories about Babylon is that of the Tower of Babel, a story that some biblical scholars believe may be based on a mistranslation, or ingenious pun. The Book of Genesis tells how the survivors of the Great Flood wanted to build a tower that would reach the heavens, but God smites the builders for their arrogance and disperses them over the Earth, where they are forced to speak many different languages. The story originates in a Hebrew belief that the name Babel was formed from the Hebrew word meaning confusion, or mixing up (and from which the English word \u201cbabble\u201d is derived). Ironically, this interpretation was itself a confusing of languages. In Akkadian, the root of the words Babylon and Babel does not mean to mix; it means \u201cgateway of the gods.\u201d\n\nArchaeologists believe that the tower referenced in the Bible story may be the Etemenanki, a giant ziggurat in Babylon dedicated to Marduk. Its name means, suggestively, the \u201ctemple of the foundation of heaven and earth,\u201d which dovetails with the names mentioned in the story. When it was surveyed in 1913, the Etemenanki revealed that the tower that supposedly reached right up to the heavens would have been, in reality, nearer 200 feet in height.\n\nAnother colorful story to come out of the ancient city is that of the fabulous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. There are many theories surrounding the gardens, from their exact location to the identities of their builders. Some suggest the gardens formed a part of the royal palace in Babylon itself, while others believe they were built in another city altogether. One origin story claims that Nebuchadrezzar had them built for his wife, Amytis. In the course of Koldewey\u2019s excavations of the ancient city, his team identified a mysterious structure in one corner of Babylon\u2019s southern palace. It was made of 14 long rooms with vaulted ceilings laid out in two rows. A complex of wells and channels were found at the site.

        "text": "Sparta\u2019s entire culture centered on war. A lifelong dedication to military discipline, service, and precision gave this kingdom a strong advantage over other Greek civilizations, allowing Sparta to dominate Greece in the fifth century B.C. Sparta\u2019s enemies, when facing the intimidating Spartan forces, would see a wall of shields, bristling with lances, inexorably bearing down on them\u2014not to the beat of drums, but as the Greek historian Thucydides explains, \u201cto the music of many ute-players, a standing institution in their army, which has nothing to do with religion, but is meant to make them advance evenly, stepping in time, without breaking their order.\u201d Little remains of the ancient city of Sparta, capital of the Laconia region, situated on the Peloponnesus peninsula in modern Greece, but the impact of its unique culture is impossible to ignore. Unlike Athens to the north, Sparta was famed for its austerity\u2014its \u201cspartan\u201d character\u2014was, and is, proverbial. A state run by an inflexible military regime, whose people existed almost entirely to serve the army, the Spartans were legendary for their professionalism, intense physical and mental stamina, and absolute dedication to the defense of their land. No great philosophers would ever arise from Spartan culture the way they did from Athens. Founded around the ninth century B.C., Sparta\u2019s kings oversaw a society with little interest in intellectual and artistic pursuits beyond patriotic poetry. Religion did occupy a central role in this warrior society. An efficient military machine in almost every other respect, war was only unthinkable during the festivities dedicated to Apollo Carneus. These were celebrated every summer, sometimes in full campaign season, and it was considered impious to interrupt them. The Athenian view of Sparta oscillated between admiration and fear, according to whether their warlike neighbors were allies or enemies. Without Spartan participation in the war against Persia at the beginning of the fifth century B.C.\u2014 especially their heroic stand at the critical Battle of Thermopylae in 480\u2014the Persians may well have conquered Greece. Later in the same century, however, Athens found itself at war with its ferocious former ally, a venture that greatly sapped its energy and resources. Even as Athens experienced a Golden Age, the conflict with Sparta largely brought about its political decline. The Peloponnesian War in which Athens fought Sparta began in 431 B.C. At the outset, the Athenian statesman Pericles ordered all inhabitants of the Attica region to take refuge within the capital\u2019s strong walls. Despite grumbling from some quarters that this amounted to cowardice, many Athenians understood Pericles\u2019pragmatism. Athens was strong at sea, but the Spartans were invincible on land. Pericles knew that facing the enemy there would mean certain defeat. Sparta\u2019s total dedication to military greatness and discipline earned them their fearsome reputation and their enemies\u2019 respect. From birth, Spartan boys were prepared both physically and mentally for their later, inevitable combat service. Most boys lived with their families until age seven, after which time they were delivered to the agoge\u2014part military academy, part boot camp\u2014to be trained as soldiers. Family ties loosened, and young recruits effectively belonged to the state. The first-century Roman historian Plutarch details the regime to which young Spartans were subjected: [T]heir training was calculated to make them obey commands well, endure hardships, and conquer in battle ... When they were 12 years old, they no longer had tunics to wear, received one cloak a year, had hard flesh, and knew little of baths. They slept together ... on pallet-beds which they collected for themselves, breaking off with their hands\u2014no knives allowed\u2014the tops of the rushes which grew along the river Eurotas. Ages 7-12 When war loomed, the Gerousia, the council of elders, decided when to draw from this silo of young fighters. Their proposal then had to be approved by the Spartan assembly. Spartan men aged between 20 and 60 would then be called up, starting with the most experienced. Each year the ephors, or magistrates, chose the 300 best hoplites in Sparta to become the hippeis\u2014elite soldiers who formed the king\u2019s private guard.    Some hoplite shields, like the one above, were designed with openings through which spears could be thrust. Oliveriano Archaeological Museum, Pesaro, Italy     Known as a hoplon\u2014from which is derived the name of its bearer, the hoplite\u2014the shield was, together with the spear, the most important weapon of the Spartan warrior. Each shield was circular and convex, weighed more than 15 pounds, and measured three feet in diameter. Shields were specially made out of layers of wood that had been rounded off and glued together. The exterior was covered with a fine layer of bronze, whose surface, glinting in the sun and replicated across the formation, would present a daunting spectacle to an enemy. The Spartan hoplites organized themselves into a tight-packed phalanx that then relentlessly pushed forward behind this wall of bronze. There were many reasons for launching a military campaign. For example, Sparta might face an existential threat, prompting its participation in the Battle of Plataea in 479 B.C., which effectively ended all Persian attempts to invade the Greek lands. At other times, Sparta engaged in disputes with its rival Greek city-states, especially Athens and Thebes. Slave rebellions had to be nipped in the bud\u2014the Helots, conquered peoples enslaved by the Spartans, had to be routinely subdued. When facing a foreign foe, the Spartan king would first offer a sacrifice to Zeus Agetor, in order to know whether the gods approved of the campaign. If it was discerned that they did, the official fire bearer, the pyrphorus, would take up the sacred fire from the altar and carry it with him throughout the march in order to ensure divine protection. As a bonus, it also provided the expedition with a constant source of fire. The meat of the goats and sheep sacrificed to Zeus was then used as food for the soldiers. During the march, the Skiritai, the mountain-dwelling mercenaries to the north of Sparta, and calvary were placed at the front. They carried light weapons and formed a daunting defensive and scouting force at the front of the convoy. Next came the hoplites in two long lines, flanking the cargo mules; the Helot slave porters; and the noncombatants\u2014physicians, artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, and tanners, bearing all the objects that the company might need. Each soldier would carry 20 days worth of provisions with him. This consisted of rye bread, cheese, and salted meat, which in the spirit of Spartan egalitarianism was distributed among soldiers and officers alike. Most campaigns took place in the late spring, when water was scarce, so drinking water also had to be hauled. Every Spartan soldier carried his own weapons, while a Helot slave took charge of his other belongings. At night the soldiers had no more than capes to protect them from the cold. They did not sleep in tents but lay on the ground or under simple shelters. After the army arrived at the border of the Spartan region, the king made a new sacrifice, this time dedicated to Zeus and Athena. Upon reaching the battlefield, the Spartans set up camp in the most appropriate place\u2014close to a water source when possible. The camp itself was laid out in the form of a square, with the animals, supplies, and slaves placed in the middle. The elite Skiritai and cavalry made constant patrols of the high ground to keep watch. Sometimes the guard was more concerned about the Helot slaves trying to flee the camp than about an attack from the rival army. The Spartan soldiers kept to a strict schedule when on campaign. Having offered the appropriate morning sacrifice, the king gave the day\u2019s orders to his officers. There would be physical exercise before breakfast, an inspection, a changeover of those on guard duty and then military instruction. The historian Plutarch notes that, paradoxically, war for Spartans was seen almost as a holiday: \u201cTheir bodily exercises, too, were less rigorous during their campaigns, and [they] were allowed a regimen less rigid. They were the only men in the world for whom war brought a respite in the training for war.\u201d In the afternoon the soldiers would compete in athletic exercises in which a polemarch (high-ranking military commander) acted as judge and gave a prize to the winner, this usually being meat for dinner. At the end of the day the soldiers would sing hymns and poems by the seventh-century B.C. poet Tyrtaeus, whose work exalted Spartan patriotism. Dressed for battle, Spartans and Athenians looked alike. This painted Athenian cup (above) shows the traits that would have been displayed by all such groups across the Greek-speaking world in the 400s B.C. In previous centuries Greek warriors had worn very thick, heavy armor, much of which, by the classical period, had been largely dispensed with. For those fighting on either side in the Peloponnesian War, the armor would have been made up of: (1) greaves over the legs; (2) a breastplate; and (3) a helmet. By this period, the solid bronze armor plates had been replaced with pieces made from layers of linen stuck together, stiffened by immersion in vinegar and salt, and reinforced with layers of bronze. As well as for defense, (4) the shield was used to batter and barge. Each soldier bore a long lance and (5) a short iron sword. Despite the uniformity in hoplite dress, the Spartan warrior wore a distinctive scarlet cape to protect him from the cold, although it was always removed before combat. At daybreak on the morning of the battle, sometimes within sight of the enemy, the Spartan hoplites would polish their bronze-coated shields, prepare their weapons, and carefully arrange their long hair, as part of a symbolically charged ritual. When the battle was imminent, a young goat would be sacrificed to Artemis Agrotera, goddess of the hunt. The sages examined the entrails under the watchful eye of the king, who would only give the order to attack if he could count on divine approval. When the trumpet sounded, all the Spartan hoplites would chant a paean or war song called the \u201cSong of Castor,\u201d named in honor of a venerated Spartan hero. The singing was accompanied by the flautists who played from their positions within the ranks. The Spartan phalanx, a tight military formation usually eight men deep, would then begin its advance, lances raised, in time with the music. One measure of the Spartan reputation for courage and nerve was the pace with which it proceeded: Its army would draw close to enemy lines more slowly than their rivals, always following the steady rhythm set by the flutes. Sparta\u2019s battle methods were similar to those employed elsewhere in the Greek-speaking world. Hoplite warriors formed phalanxes, which advanced in lockstep. The front row presented a barrier of shields locked together, from which a long line of spears protruded. Unity within the phalanx was crucial, and Spartan phalanxes had a fearsome reputation for holding their formation. During the Peloponnesian War, both the Spartan and Athenian sides made use of an additional class of soldier, the peltasts. This division of light infantry supplemented the heavily armed\u2014and often unwieldy\u2014hoplites. But the phalanx remained the Spartans\u2019 primary strength. Enemy commanders justly feared the colossal damage this disciplined mass could inflict. The phalanx was formed of compact columns of hoplites who maintained the formation at the exact width and depth required. Wielding a greater and more powerful block of fighters than the enemy was one of the keys to victory. The Spartan formation was typically a minimum of eight lines deep. (1) Each soldier had his own spear, which he held in front of him, parallel to that of his fellow warriors. The aim for those in the front row was to injure the arms, throat, or eyes of their opponents. (2) The front lines made use of their shields to thrust forward into the enemy line and attempt to breach it. If a breakthrough happened, it almost always spelled the beginning of the end for the Spartans\u2019 enemies. When the first lines clashed, all the soldiers would push forward with their shields. Every hoplite pressed hard against the back of the man in front, while those in the first three or four lines hurled their lances. The purpose of the phalanx was to smash the enemy line. Until a breach was made, there were few casualties within the tightly packed Spartan lines, and the soldiers behind could immediately cover the gaps left by any men who did fall. If a phalanx did ever fall apart, the soldiers were left vulnerable, tempted to abandon their shields in order to flee. For the Spartans, such an outcome was almost too shameful to contemplate. Rhipsaspia, \u201cthe throwing away of one\u2019s shield in battle,\u201d effectively meant desertion. Despite their frightening reputation, the Spartan army was very restrained when it defeated a foe. According to Thucydides, the Spartans \u201cfought long and stubbornly until the rout of their enemy, but that achieved, pursuing them only for a short time, and not far.\u201d This practice was, at heart, pragmatic: Having secured the military objective, there was little sense in unnecessarily exposing Spartan forces to further danger, especially if the enemy had men mounted on horseback. Instead, the king would order the trumpeters to sound the retreat, and the army would start to retrieve the dead. When vanquished enemies wanted to retrieve the bodies of their fallen, they would send a representative to negotiate the handover with the king of Sparta. The bodies of the fallen Spartans were carried on their own shields to a site near the battlefield for burial. They would be honored with a memorial engraved with an epitaph, such as that composed for the Spartans who died defending the Thermopylae pass against the Persians: \u201cO Stranger, tell the Spartans that here we remain, obedient to their orders.\u201d From age seven, a Spartan boy was sent to the military academy known as the agoge, where he would be put underthe supervision of a teacher and instructor, the paidonomos. From there, he would then be enlisted in the Spartan army. From age 20 to 29, he was part of the hebontes, an age group regarded by Spartan society as not yet fully adult, since marriage was only encouraged after age 30. In theory, all Spartan males were bound to military service until achieving the status of elder, or geron, at age 60, but many continued to serve on the battlefield. One of Sparta\u2019s later kings, Archidamus III (above) fell in battle in 338 B.C. when he was thought to be around 62 years old. In a time-honored Spartan tradition, other markers were often erected on the site of the battle. One of the most common was a tree trunk dressed in the helmet, armor, and weapons of the defeated. If the battle was particularly significant, a stone monument might be constructed, such as the statue of the lion in honor of the Spartan leader Leonidas, which was placed on the battlefield of Thermopylae. When the rituals were over, the army began their triumphal return to Sparta. For those who did not come back, their family\u2019s grief at their loss was salved by the tributes of a society who exalted the fallen as heroes. The worst fate for any Spartan was cowardice on the battlefield. Throughout history, mothers have wept in seeing their sons set out for war; Spartan women, however, developed another ritual, aimed at preventing the ignominy that would befall them if their son wavered in the line of duty. Plutarch records Spartan mothers handing the shield to their sons, with the exhortation: Either with this or upon this\u2014either return with the shield, victorious; or return lying on it, dead.

From birth, Spartan boys were prepared both physically and mentally for their later, inevitable combat service. Most boys lived with their families until age seven, after which time they were delivered to the agoge\u2014part military academy, part boot camp\u2014to be trained as soldiers. Family ties loosened, and young recruits effectively belonged to the state.\n\nThe first-century Roman historian Plutarch details the regime to which young Spartans were subjected: [T]heir training was calculated to make them obey commands well, endure hardships, and conquer in battle ... When they were 12 years old, they no longer had tunics to wear, received one cloak a year, had hard flesh, and knew little of baths. They slept together ... on pallet-beds which they collected for themselves, breaking off with their hands\u2014no knives allowed\u2014the tops of the rushes which grew along the river Eurotas.\n\nWhen war loomed, the Gerousia, the council of elders, decided when to draw from this silo of young fighters. Their proposal then had to be approved by the Spartan assembly. Spartan men aged between 20 and 60 would then be called up, starting with the most experienced. Each year the ephors, or magistrates, chose the 300 best hoplites in Sparta to become the hippeis\u2014elite soldiers who formed the king\u2019s private guard.\n\nKnown as a hoplon\u2014from which is derived the name of its bearer, the hoplite\u2014the shield was, together with the spear, the most important weapon of the Spartan warrior. Each shield was circular and convex, weighed more than 15 pounds, and measured three feet in diameter. Shields were specially made out of layers of wood that had been rounded off and glued together. The exterior was covered with a fine layer of bronze, whose surface, glinting in the sun and replicated across the formation, would present a daunting spectacle to an enemy.\n\nThe Spartan hoplites organized themselves into a tight-packed phalanx that then relentlessly pushed forward behind this wall of bronze. There were many reasons for launching a military campaign. For example, Sparta might face an existential threat, prompting its participation in the Battle of Plataea in 479 B.C., which effectively ended all Persian attempts to invade the Greek lands. At other times, Sparta engaged in disputes with its rival Greek city-states, especially Athens and Thebes. Slave rebellions had to be nipped in the bud\u2014the Helots, conquered peoples enslaved by the Spartans, had to be routinely subdued.\n\nWhen facing a foreign foe, the Spartan king would first offer a sacrifice to Zeus Agetor, in order to know whether the gods approved of the campaign. If it was discerned that they did, the official fire bearer, the pyrphorus, would take up the sacred fire from the altar and carry it with him throughout the march in order to ensure divine protection. As a bonus, it also provided the expedition with a constant source of fire. The meat of the goats and sheep sacrificed to Zeus was then used as food for the soldiers.\n\nDuring the march, the Skiritai, the mountain-dwelling mercenaries to the north of Sparta, and cavalry were placed at the front. They carried light weapons and formed a daunting defensive and scouting force at the front of the convoy. Next came the hoplites in two long lines, flanking the cargo mules; the Helot slave porters; and the noncombatants\u2014physicians, artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, and tanners, bearing all the objects that the company might need. Each soldier would carry 20 days worth of provisions with him. This consisted of rye bread, cheese, and salted meat, which in the spirit of Spartan egalitarianism was distributed among soldiers and officers alike.\n\nMost campaigns took place in the late spring, when water was scarce, so drinking water also had to be hauled. Every Spartan soldier carried his own weapons, while a Helot slave took charge of his other belongings. At night the soldiers had no more than capes to protect them from the cold. They did not sleep in tents but lay on the ground or under simple shelters.\n\nAfter the army arrived at the border of the Spartan region, the king made a new sacrifice, this time dedicated to Zeus and Athena. Upon reaching the battlefield, the Spartans set up camp in the most appropriate place\u2014close to a water source when possible. The camp itself was laid out in the form of a square, with the animals, supplies, and slaves placed in the middle. The elite Skiritai and cavalry made constant patrols of the high ground to keep watch. Sometimes the guard was more concerned about the Helot slaves trying to flee the camp than about an attack from the rival army.\n\nThe Spartan soldiers kept to a strict schedule when on campaign. Having offered the appropriate morning sacrifice, the king gave the day\u2019s orders to his officers. There would be physical exercise before breakfast, an inspection, a changeover of those on guard duty and then military instruction. The historian Plutarch notes that, paradoxically, war for Spartans was seen almost as a holiday: \u201cTheir bodily exercises, too, were less rigorous during their campaigns, and [they] were allowed a regimen less rigid. They were the only men in the world for whom war brought a respite in the training for war.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon the soldiers would compete in athletic exercises in which a polemarch (high-ranking military commander) acted as judge and gave a prize to the winner, this usually being meat for dinner. At the end of the day the soldiers would sing hymns and poems by the seventh-century B.C. poet Tyrtaeus, whose work exalted Spartan patriotism.\n\nDressed for battle, Spartans and Athenians looked alike. This painted Athenian cup shows the traits that would have been displayed by all such groups across the Greek-speaking world in the 400s B.C. In previous centuries Greek warriors had worn very thick, heavy armor, much of which, by the classical period, had been largely dispensed with. For those fighting on either side in the Peloponnesian War, the armor would have been made up of: (1) greaves over the legs; (2) a breastplate; and (3) a helmet. By this period, the solid bronze armor plates had been replaced with pieces made from layers of linen stuck together, stiffened by immersion in vinegar and salt, and reinforced with layers of bronze.\n\nAs well as for defense, (4) the shield was used to batter and barge. Each soldier bore a long lance and (5) a short iron sword. Despite the uniformity in hoplite dress, the Spartan warrior wore a distinctive scarlet cape to protect him from the cold, although it was always removed before combat.\n\nAt daybreak on the morning of the battle, sometimes within sight of the enemy, the Spartan hoplites would polish their bronze-coated shields, prepare their weapons, and carefully arrange their long hair, as part of a symbolically charged ritual. When the battle was imminent, a young goat would be sacrificed to Artemis Agrotera, goddess of the hunt. The sages examined the entrails under the watchful eye of the king, who would only give the order to attack if he could count on divine approval.\n\nWhen the trumpet sounded, all the Spartan hoplites would chant a paean or war song called the \u201cSong of Castor,\u201d named in honor of a venerated Spartan hero. The singing was accompanied by the flautists who played from their positions within the ranks. The Spartan phalanx, a tight military formation usually eight men deep, would then begin its advance, lances raised, in time with the music.\n\nOne measure of the Spartan reputation for courage and nerve was the pace with which it proceeded: Its army would draw close to enemy lines more slowly than their rivals, always following the steady rhythm set by the flutes. Sparta\u2019s battle methods were similar to those employed elsewhere in the Greek-speaking world. Hoplite warriors formed phalanxes, which advanced in lockstep. The front row presented a barrier of shields locked together, from which a long line of spears protruded. Unity within the phalanx was crucial, and Spartan phalanxes had a fearsome reputation for holding their formation.\n\nDuring the Peloponnesian War, both the Spartan and Athenian sides made use of an additional class of soldier, the peltasts. This division of light infantry supplemented the heavily armed\u2014and often unwieldy\u2014hoplites. But the phalanx remained the Spartans\u2019 primary strength. Enemy commanders justly feared the colossal damage this disciplined mass could inflict.\n\nThe phalanx was formed of compact columns of hoplites who maintained the formation at the exact width and depth required. Wielding a greater and more powerful block of fighters than the enemy was one of the keys to victory. The Spartan formation was typically a minimum of eight lines deep. (1) Each soldier had his own spear, which he held in front of him, parallel to that of his fellow warriors. The aim for those in the front row was to injure the arms, throat, or eyes of their opponents. (2) The front lines made use of their shields to thrust forward into the enemy line and attempt to breach it. If a breakthrough happened, it almost always spelled the beginning of the end for the Spartans\u2019 enemies.\n\nWhen the first lines clashed, all the soldiers would push forward with their shields. Every hoplite pressed hard against the back of the man in front, while those in the first three or four lines hurled their lances. The purpose of the phalanx was to smash the enemy line. Until a breach was made, there were few casualties within the tightly packed Spartan lines, and the soldiers behind could immediately cover the gaps left by any men who did fall. If a phalanx did ever fall apart, the soldiers were left vulnerable, tempted to abandon their shields in order to flee.\n\nFor the Spartans, such an outcome was almost too shameful to contemplate. Rhipsaspia, \u201cthe throwing away of one\u2019s shield in battle,\u201d effectively meant desertion. Despite their frightening reputation, the Spartan army was very restrained when it defeated a foe. According to Thucydides, the Spartans \u201cfought long and stubbornly until the rout of their enemy, but that achieved, pursuing them only for a short time, and not far.\u201d\n\nThis practice was, at heart, pragmatic: Having secured the military objective, there was little sense in unnecessarily exposing Spartan forces to further danger, especially if the enemy had men mounted on horseback. Instead, the king would order the trumpeters to sound the retreat, and the army would start to retrieve the dead. When vanquished enemies wanted to retrieve the bodies of their fallen, they would send a representative to negotiate the handover with the king of Sparta.\n\nThe bodies of the fallen Spartans were carried on their own shields to a site near the battlefield for burial. They would be honored with a memorial engraved with an epitaph, such as that composed for the Spartans who died defending the Thermopylae pass against the Persians: \u201cO Stranger, tell the Spartans that here we remain, obedient to their orders.\u201d\n\nFrom age seven, a Spartan boy was sent to the military academy known as the agoge, where he would be put under the supervision of a teacher and instructor, the paidonomos. From there, he would then be enlisted in the Spartan army. From age 20 to 29, he was part of the hebontes, an age group regarded by Spartan society as not yet fully adult, since marriage was only encouraged after age 30. In theory, all Spartan males were bound to military service until achieving the status of elder, or geron, at age 60, but many continued to serve on the battlefield.\n\nOne of Sparta\u2019s later kings, Archidamus III fell in battle in 338 B.C. when he was thought to be around 62 years old. In a time-honored Spartan tradition, other markers were often erected on the site of the battle. One of the most common was a tree trunk dressed in the helmet, armor, and weapons of the defeated. If the battle was particularly significant, a stone monument might be constructed, such as the statue of the lion in honor of the Spartan leader Leonidas, which was placed on the battlefield of Thermopylae.\n\nWhen the rituals were over, the army began their triumphal return to Sparta. For those who did not come back, their family\u2019s grief at their loss was salved by the tributes of a society who exalted the fallen as heroes. The worst fate for any Spartan was cowardice on the battlefield. Throughout history, mothers have wept in seeing their sons set out for war; Spartan women, however, developed another ritual, aimed at preventing the ignominy that would befall them if their son wavered in the line of duty. Plutarch records Spartan mothers handing the shield to their sons, with the exhortation: Either with this or upon this\u2014either return with the shield, victorious; or return lying on it, dead."

        "text": "In 1502, as Europeans hungrily looked to the vast new continent across the Atlantic Ocean, innovative maps of these unfamiliar territories became objects of power and intrigue. Alberto Cantino, an Italian spy, acquired a Portuguese map showing stunning finds in the New World. Knowledge is power\u2014and no knowledge was more assiduously coveted by European nations in the early 16th century than the information recorded on nautical maps. Coastlines, harbors, rivers, resources: Details about these features could give a nation a distinct advantage in trying to stake a claim to new lands. The \u201cCantino Planisphere,\u201d completed in 1502, is the second known chart to have depicted the New World. It included unpublished information on Portuguese trade routes and the ongoing discovery of the coastline of modern-day Brazil. At a time when knowledge of new territories lent expanding nations great strategic and commercial superiority, such maps were guarded as state secrets. Spies would do anything to get their hands on them. Comprising six pieces of parchment attached to a large canvas measuring about four by eight feet, the \u201cCantino Planisphere\u201d was created in Lisbon. The word \u201cplanisphere\u201d means a sphere represented as a plane (i.e., a flat surface) and is more typically used to describe star charts. It is named for Alberto Cantino, who was working in Portugal as an undercover agent of Ercole I d\u2019Este, the Duke of Ferrara, a powerful city-state in northern Italy. Historical accounts differ as to how Cantino acquired the map. According to one version, he contracted a well-connected mapmaker to sneak into a Portuguese repository of nautical charts and compile the information he gleaned to create this map. Other historians argue the map already existed, and Cantino used Ferrara\u2019s considerable wealth to buy it. Whichever way the map was acquired, records show that Cantino paid a hefty price for it: 12 gold ducats, a large sum at the time. Mapmakers of this age were faced with a colossal task: to unite extensive oral and written sources into a single image. Created a year or two before Cantino\u2019s map, the earliest known depiction of the New World was made by Juan de la Cosa, a colleague of Christopher Columbus. Both maps reveal the great challenge the New World presented to mapmakers, who were still relying on centuries-old cartographic traditions. Medieval maps were usually constructed using a wind rose (a diagram showing the frequency, strength, and direction of different winds), from which lines emerged depicting different routes. This information was suitable for coastal navigation; when equipped with a compass, navigators could rely on the coastline as a visual reference. Transatlantic navigation, of course, meant leaving the coastline behind, and Cantino\u2019s map testifies to a key moment in cartography: the transition to astronavigation. The first map to include the Equator, tropics, and the Arctic Circle, the \u201cCantino Planisphere\u201d is also the first map to show the \u201cTordesillas line,\u201d running north to south, which set the border between Spanish and Portuguese territories. Portugal could claim lands east of this line, while Spain could lay claim to lands to the west. The \u201cCantino Planisphere\u201d reflects the attempts to pack a map with key political, cultural, and economic information. Illustrations of local wildlife appear on the map: gray Senegal parrots in West Africa contrasting with the colorful macaws depicted in South America. Colonial landmarks are also shown in West Africa, such as the castle of Sa\u0303o Jorge da Mina, built in the 1480s by John II of Portugal, which grew into a major African trade hub. The journeys of 15th- and 16th-century European explorers are depicted on Cantino\u2019s map including Vasco da Gama\u2019s first voyage in search of a sea route to India (1497-99) and the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Brazilian coast in 1500 by compatriot Pedro A\u0301lvares Cabral (although some historians argue the Spaniard Vicente Ya\u0301n\u0303ez Pinzo\u0301n got there first). The information gathered from Columbus\u2019s most recent voyages in the West Indies is seen on the planisphere, as well as is the coastline of modern-day Venezuela. It is the first map to name the Antilles, the archipelago consisting principally of modern-day Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. A thumblike peninsula to the north of Cuba is thought by some historians to be the first depiction of modern-day Florida despite Juan Ponce de Leo\u0301n\u2019s being credited as the first European to have reached it\u201411 years after the planisphere was made. Fittingly for a document chronicling voyages, the planisphere itself would be subjected to a series of perilous journeys after Cantino acquired it. In 1592, it was taken from Ferrara to the Italian city of Modena. By this time it was very much an artifact, its contents out of date, but the map was still considered valuable. In the mid-19th century the planisphere was stolen, only to be found a few years later hanging on the wall of a butcher\u2019s shop in the city. Today it is safely conserved in the collection of Modena\u2019s Galleria Estense, a magnificent reminder of Europe\u2019s first efforts to chart the world as they were coming to know it.

        "title": "How Julius Caesar Started a Big War by Crossing a Small Stream",
        "text": "In 49 B.C. on the banks of the Rubicon, Julius Caesar faced a critical choice. To remain in Gaul meant forfeiting his power to his enemies in Rome. Crossing the river into Italy would be a declaration of war. Caesar chose war. On January 10, 49 B.C., on the banks of the Rubicon River in southern Gaul (near the modern-day city of Ravenna), Julius Caesar and the soldiers of the 13th Legion waited and weighed their options. The Rubicon is, in reality, little more than a stream. Its significance to Rome lay in its location, marking the official border between Italy and Cisalpine Gaul, the region south of the Alps governed by Julius Caesar. Despite its appearance, crossing this humble river would have serious consequences. According to the law of the Roman Republic, any provincial governor leading troops across the border back into Italy would be declared a public enemy. It was, quite simply, an act of war. Huddled against the biting cold, many of the soldiers of the 13th Legion of the army of the Roman Republic had served under Caesar for much of the previous decade. They had witnessed the honing of his skills as a military and political strategist, subjugating Gaul (corresponding to much of modern-day France and northern Italy), extending the bounds of the Roman Republic as far as the Rhine, and all the time shoring up his influence back in Rome. Alarmed by his growing power, the Senate ordered Caesar to set aside his command. Caesar had no intention of obeying the Senate, and he knew perfectly well what the consequences of his insubordination would be. He understood that civil war would most likely ensue between himself and the Roman nobility, led by his strongest rival and former ally: the brilliant military commander Pompey the Great. If Caesar chose to cross the Rubicon, there would be no turning back. 58-50 B.C.Roman proconsul Julius Caesar conducts a series of military campaigns to conquer Gaul, boosting his political career and bringing him the wealth to pay off his debts. 50 B.C.Following his victories in Gaul, Julius Caesar attempts to return to Rome, but his former ally Pompey and his enemies in the Senate instead order him to lay down his command. January 10-11, 49 B.C.Faced with the intransigence of the Senate, Caesar and the 13th Legion cross the Rubicon, the official border between Gaul and Italy, a decision that will lead to civil war. 49 B.C.As Caesar advances on Rome, Pompey and his allies retreat south, ultimately abandoning Italy for Greece. Caesar defeats Pompey\u2019s forces in Spain. 48 B.C.Caesar pursues Pompey across the Adriatic and decisively defeats him at the Battle of Pharsalus in Greece. After the loss, Pompey flees to Egypt where he is assassinated. 46 B.C.Caesar defeats Pompey\u2019s remaining followers at Thapsus in North Africa. Caesar becomes dictator of Rome. The day before the crossing, Caesar acted as if nothing unusual was happening. The conqueror of Gaul attended a public event in Ravenna and carefully examined plans for a gladiator school. Secretly, he had ordered his cohorts to proceed to the banks of the river and wait for him there. Later, during dinner that night, he told his guests he would have to leave them for a moment. A chariot pulled by mules from a nearby bakery was waiting for him outside, and after a considerable delay in finding the exact position of his troops, he eventually managed to join them on the bank. Here he mulled the agonizing choice that lay before him. Writing around a century and a half later, the historian Suetonius produced an account of this moment that reveals the legendary status the event had attained in the Roman mind. Still unsure whether to advance, a man of extraordinary height and beauty appeared, clearly sent by the gods. \u201cThe apparition snatched a trumpet from one of them, rushed to the river, and sounding the war-note with mighty blast, strode to the opposite bank. Then Caesar cried: \u2018Take we the course which the signs of the gods and the false dealing of our foes point out. The die is cast.\u2019\u201d Caesar was not the first person to openly violate the law of the republic. Social tensions created by the rapid expansion of Roman territory had plunged the political system into crisis for much of Caesar\u2019s life. During his youth, generals and politicians often exploited their military victories to take political control of the state. Ages 7-12 Born around 100 B.C., Caesar\u2019s boyhood was marked by the Social Wars, a series of struggles in which Rome\u2019s Italian allies fought for the right to Roman citizenship and its privileges. In 81 B.C. Sulla was appointed dictator. Sulla defended the rights of Rome\u2019s increasingly discredited noble rulers against the populares, the Senate faction who represented the interests of non-noble citizens clamoring for reform. Caesar\u2019s career was marked by this atmosphere of frenzied competition for power between nobles and populists. In 60 B.C. he allied with the general Pompey and another powerful politician, Marcus Licinius Crassus, so the three of them could dominate the republican system for their own benefit. The immediate result was Caesar\u2019s consulship in 59 B.C., during which he sidelined the Senate and passed various laws aimed at winning him popular support. Stung by Caesar\u2019s affronts, the powerful aristocratic faction in the Senate\u2014known as the optimates\u2014were waiting to pounce on him when his consulship ended, when he would be left without official immunity and highly vulnerable to his enemies. Revealing his lifelong instinct for survival, however, Caesar cut a deal with Pompey and Crassus, enabling him to leave for Gaul to achieve the military glory that would, in turn, increase his grip on power. Eight years later, at the beginning of the year 50 B.C., Caesar had subjugated Gaul, to the great benefit of the republic, which had won valuable territory to defend it against invasions. But the main beneficiary of the wars was undoubtedly Caesar himself. Awash with Gallic gold, he shrewdly targeted financially embarrassed senators who, in return for Caesar\u2019s \u201cgenerosity\u201d in paying off their debts, declared themselves his unconditional allies. At the same time, he had at his back a trained, experienced, and fiercely loyal army. Caesar\u2019s combination of wealth and military clout struck fear and loathing into the hearts of senators back in Rome\u2014not least his erstwhile ally, Pompey, who since Crassus\u2019s death had been moving politically closer to the aristocratic optimates. After the fighting was ended in Gaul, Caesar was obliged to stand down from his position as governor, disband his army, and so lose the immunity his official position had given him. Pompey and his new optimate allies hatched a plan to seize the moment to take Caesar to court. By accusing him of corruption and abuses of power during his time in Gaul, they hoped to bring his political career to an end. But Caesar stood his ground in March 50 B.C. He would not stand down as governor of Gaul, as stipulated, but would instead stay on until the end of 49 B.C., proposing that in the summer of that year, he would stand for election to become consul for a second time. Faced with such obstinacy, his enemies in Rome scrambled to increase the pressure on the rogue governor. They reiterated to the Senate that since the military campaign was over, Caesar must disband his army, and a new governor of Gaul be elected to replace him. The hostile atmosphere in the Senate convinced Caesar that he needed to defend himself militarily and politically. He moved some of his troops into the north of Italy, at the same time extending his influence in the corridors of power. Bribery continued to be the most effective tool. In a particularly spectacular coup, he even managed to buy off the consul Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus for a colossal down payment of some nine million denarii. In return, the consul promised not to support any initiatives against him during his remaining term of office. The deadline for Caesar to lay down his command, March 50 B.C., came and went. An emergency briefly offered a way out of the stalemate: The Parthians were threatening Rome\u2019s eastern borders and the Senate was asked to send two legions to defend the province of Syria. Pompey declared that he would send one if Caesar sent another. Caesar surprisingly accepted, perhaps to demonstrate a willingness to compromise. According to Caesar\u2019s own account of these tumultuous years, The Gallic Wars, the legion assigned to Pompey was Caesar\u2019s anyway. Keeping his promise, Caesar handed over the 15th Legion, quartered in Cisalpine Gaul, only to find out that the Parthian threat had petered out and that both legions now lay firmly under the control of Pompey in Italy. Far from undermining Caesar\u2019s confidence, Pompey\u2019s deceitful maneuver only seemed to stiffen his resolve. Throughout that year, the brinkmanship between the two generals grew, and nerves stretched to breaking point. A false rumor spread that Caesar had set out from Gaul with four legions. The statesman and orator Cicero vainly tried to find a peaceful solution to the conflict while a sense that the republic was becoming increasingly ungovernable took hold in the capital. Alliances shifted continually: One of Caesar\u2019s most loyal lieutenants, Labienus, decided to switch sides to Pompey. Meanwhile, Pompey had convinced himself that his forces were stronger than Caesar\u2019s and that his charismatic leadership would enable him to recruit as many men as he wished in Italy. According to the late first-century historian Plutarch, a contemporary of Suetonius: \u201cWhen they said that if Caesar was heading to Rome they could not see what troops could withstand him, Pompey boastfully replied with a smile: \u2018Legions will spring up anywhere I stamp on the ground in Italy.\u2019\u201d Marcus Caelius Rufus, an aristocrat, summarized the situation in a letter to Cicero in the fall of that year: \u201cThe closer we come to this inevitable clash, the more apparent the danger. At the heart of the issue is this: Pompey declares he won\u2019t allow Caesar to be elected consul unless Caesar relinquishes control over his army and provinces; Caesar, on the other hand, is convinced his status is threatened if he gives up his troops ... So now ... their scandalous liaison isn\u2019t stepping behind the scenes ... but exploding into full-scale war!\u201d Most of the terrified senators were willing to grant the concessions Caesar was asking for to avoid war. In December, when the plebeian leader Curio persuaded the Senate to vote on the proposal for Caesar and Pompey to lay down their arms at the same time, 370 senators voted for it and just 22 against. But the faction opposing Caesar immediately went against the spirit of this decision. They sought out Pompey in the Forum and dramatically placed a sword in his hand, begging him to take command of Italy\u2019s troops to save the republic. They urged him to take command of the army and of as many additional troops as he wanted to recruit himself. Although he was breaking the law, Pompey accepted the mission. As the year 49 B.C. opened, Caesar sent the Senate a letter from Ravenna, giving them his final word on the matter. He again offered to resign his command at the same time as Pompey, but the Senate interpreted his proposal as a gesture of arrogance. Pompey and the consuls prevented a vote on the proposal in the letter and passed a motion declaring Caesar a public enemy. The motion was vetoed by Mark Antony, the newly appointed plebeian tribune and crucial ally of Caesar who would prove to play a fateful role in the last stages of his life. Even so, negotiations went on until the very last moment. Caesar even said he would stand down if he were allowed to keep just one legion and govern the province of Illyria, in the modern-day Balkans. The proposal might have been acceptable but was rejected due to fierce opposition by Cato the Younger, one of Caesar\u2019s most implacable opponents. The Senate met again and passed a decree calling on the consuls to defend Rome against any attack. The tribunes Mark Antony and Quintus Cassius (a relative of the famous Cassius who later conspired to assassinate Caesar) exercised their veto, but it was rejected by the Senate. Fearing for their lives, Mark Antony and Cassius fled Rome disguised as slaves and joined Caesar in the north. Writing later in The Civil Wars, Caesar recalled how he had been waiting for the Senate\u2019s response for days \u201c[to see] if matters could be brought to a peaceful end by any equitable act on the part of his enemies.\u201d But he now realized there was no other way and started preparing for the final showdown. Around January 10, when he learned of the Senate\u2019s decision, he ordered the 13th Legion to take up their riverside positions, exhorting them to defend the honor of their general whom they had served for nine years. They in turn swore to avenge the insults against him and the tribunes. Caesar now had the backing of a loyal army who would follow him to victory or death. According to the poet Lucan, Caesar declared: \u201cHere I abandon peace and desecrated law. Fortune, it is you I follow. Farewell to treaties. From now on, war is our judge.\u201d The news that Caesar had crossed the Rubicon reached Rome on January 15. Pompey\u2019s supporters fled in a panic, believing the exaggerated rumors of the size of Caesar\u2019s force\u2014perhaps understandable, given Caesar\u2019s fearsome reputation in Gaul. Rome was emptied of most of the senators and its most influential citizens. Those who stayed in the city were filled with foreboding. Writing a century later, the historian Dio Cassius described the terrifying portents Romans had seen around this time. Wolves were sighted. Earthquakes, comets, and a solar eclipse were seen, and there were reports of the birth of monstrous animals. The Capitol was struck by lightning, which damaged the statues of Jupiter and Mars. It all seemed to portend a terrible disaster for the city: a sacking carried out by vengeful and battle-hardened legions fresh from Gaul. Three months later, however, when he finally entered Rome following Pompey\u2019s flight to Greece, Caesar imposed discipline on his men and reestablished the appearance of legality by holding a Senate meeting on the outskirts of the city. Although few senators actually attended, it sent a clear signal that he was now to be regarded as the sole authority in Rome. The choice facing Rome was either decades of more factionalism and political chaos, or accepting a strongman to impose reform, and set its affairs in order. On swiftly passing to the far bank of this minor river, Caesar set the republic hurtling down the second course. Since crossing the Rubicon, Caesar and his legions had expelled Pompey and his troops from Italy. But this campaign was just the beginning. In the attempt to destroy Pompey and his extensive allies across the Roman world, Caesar was forced to cover astonishing distances, putting down a revolt in modern-day Marseille in France before routing Pompey\u2019s loyalists in Spain at the Battle of Ilerda in June. The following year, 48 B.C., Caesar dedicated to pursuing Pompey across Greece. Crossing to Egypt after his defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus, Pompey threw himself on the mercy of Ptolemy XIII, who immediately had him murdered. The Egyptian ruler evidently saw where the tide of Roman power was flowing. Shortly after the removal of his military rival, Caesar arrived in Egypt, where he patched up the dynastic struggle between Ptolemy and his sister, Cleopatra VII. Little knowing she would become the last of the Ptolemaic monarchs who had ruled Egypt since the time of Alexander the Great, Cleopatra spent much of that same year as Caesar\u2019s lover, sealing her reputation in the Roman world as a femme fatale who would later \u201censnare\u201d Mark Antony. As the Alexandrian romance eventually faltered, war once again proved the constant in Caesar\u2019s life. Despite the death of their captain, Pompey\u2019s supporters had regrouped in order to avenge him, and Caesar was forced to buckle on his armor again, briefly returning to Rome before dealing a crushing blow against his enemies in modern-day Tunisia in 46 B.C. Even then, resistance to the new order bubbled up in the following months. Caesar only delivered the death blow to Pompey\u2019s stubborn followers in Spain a year later, in 45 B.C. Having returned to Rome, he continued implementing significant reforms in the year of life left to him. These included improving land and grain distribution, as well as the reorganization of local government across Italy. No doubt Caesar hoped for many years of life to enact his reforms\u2014but where he had defeated his enemies on the battlefield, he proved more vulnerable in the corridors of power. On that infamous March day the following year, he succumbed to the assassins\u2019 knives. What would have happened had Caesar not made that fateful river crossing five years previously? What would have happened if the republican old guard that assassinated him had prevailed over Mark Antony, reinforced republican power, and steered the Roman world away from autocratic rule? In the event, he was succeeded by his adopted son, Octavian, who consolidated the drift toward authoritarian leadership, later becoming the Emperor Augustus. Under this brilliant, implacable leader, the new Roman Empire buried the old, aristocratic infighting to become a global power, whose astonishing legacy continues to shape the modern world.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nOn the banks of the Rubicon, Julius Caesar faced a critical choice. To remain in Gaul meant forfeiting his power to his enemies in Rome. Crossing the river into Italy would be a declaration of war. Caesar chose war.\n\nOn January 10, 49 B.C., on the banks of the Rubicon River in southern Gaul, Julius Caesar and the soldiers of the 13th Legion waited and weighed their options. The Rubicon is, in reality, little more than a stream. Its significance to Rome lay in its location, marking the official border between Italy and Cisalpine Gaul, the region south of the Alps governed by Julius Caesar.\n\nDespite its appearance, crossing this humble river would have serious consequences. According to the law of the Roman Republic, any provincial governor leading troops across the border back into Italy would be declared a public enemy. It was, quite simply, an act of war.\n\nHuddled against the biting cold, many of the soldiers of the 13th Legion of the army of the Roman Republic had served under Caesar for much of the previous decade. They had witnessed the honing of his skills as a military and political strategist, subjugating Gaul, extending the bounds of the Roman Republic as far as the Rhine, and all the time shoring up his influence back in Rome.\n\nAlarmed by his growing power, the Senate ordered Caesar to set aside his command. Caesar had no intention of obeying the Senate, and he knew perfectly well what the consequences of his insubordination would be. He understood that civil war would most likely ensue between himself and the Roman nobility, led by his strongest rival and former ally: the brilliant military commander Pompey the Great.\n\nIf Caesar chose to cross the Rubicon, there would be no turning back.\n\n...\n\n(The rest of the article continues, but I removed the timeline and copyright information)"

        "title": "The ghostly treasure ship of Sutton Hoo",
        "text": "In 1939 a series of mounds at Sutton Hoo in England revealed their astounding contents: the remains of an Anglo-Saxon funerary ship and a huge cache of seventh-century royal treasure. In southern England near the Suffolk coast lies a stretch of sandy heathland dotted by mysterious mounds of earth. Inspiring strange tales and superstitions among local people, these barrows charmed newlyweds Frank and Edith Pretty, who purchased the property, known as Sutton Hoo, in 1926. The couple made their home at Sutton Hoo for nearly nine years until Frank\u2019s untimely death in late 1934. Edith continued to live there, and she grew increasingly curious about the barrows on her property. A lifelong fascination with the occult had led her, like many wealthy women of her time, to consult spiritualists in London. Some say that after her husband\u2019s death, her interest in spiritualism grew and even expanded to include the barrows on her property. Disputed accounts even describe Edith as having a vision of a ghostly procession passing through the mounds near her house. Whatever the true cause, she decided in 1937 to have the land excavated and approached a museum in nearby Ipswich to discuss it. Self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown worked as an excavation assistant at the museum and took on Edith\u2019s project. His decision to take the job not only would change his life but also radically alter, and deepen, the understanding scholars had of the early Anglo-Saxon period in England following the collapse of Roman rule. At first, Brown assumed that any artifacts that had once lain in the mounds would have been looted many years before. His first dig, in the summer of 1938, confirmed his initial skepticism: tumuli two, three, and four contained only a few objects and evidence of human remains. In 1939 Brown resumed the dig and turned his attention to the largest barrow, known as tumulus one. During the excavation, he came across a section of hard earth stained with rust and containing nails at regular intervals. Progressing with painstaking care, Brown realized that he had found the imprint of a ship, more than 80 feet in length. Although the wood had long since decayed, its ghostly outline and rich cargo of grave goods remained intact. How had it stayed undisturbed for so long? Luck, as it turns out. Together with Charles Phillips from the University of Cambridge, who had also joined the dig, they found evidence that grave robbers had indeed probed the site in the past. Fortunately, the thieves dug in the wrong place, narrowly missing the treasure. The collection of 263 objects included weapons, silver cutlery, gold buckles, coins, and a distinctive full-face helmet, of a kind never before recovered in Britain. Examining the artifacts, they concluded that the settlement was not Viking, as first assumed, but Anglo-Saxon. The significance of Sutton Hoo was instantly recognized. The largest Anglo-Saxon ship burial ever discovered contained artifacts of a quality and quantity never seen before, and this fresh evidence of England\u2019s early warrior society became charged with symbolism when Britain declared war on Nazi Germany later that year. In keeping with the patriotic, wartime spirit, Edith Pretty donated the find to the British Museum in London. To keep the artifacts safe during World War II, they were stored underground in the tunnels of London\u2019s rail system. In the decades since, Sutton Hoo has been studied in depth. Its treasures, which include objects from the Byzantine Empire and the Mideast, have deepened researchers\u2019 understanding of the trade networks between the Anglo-Saxons and the European mainland. For many scholars, one of the most exciting aspects of the Sutton Hoo burial is its similarity to that depicted in the Old English epic poem, Beowulf. The eponymous hero of this work is a Geat from modern-day Sweden, who comes to the aid of the Danish king. In the poem, composed in the eighth century, there is a description of the burial of one Scyld Scefing, an ancestor of the Danish royal family. According to the poem, Scyld is laid to rest in a boat, surrounded by treasures. Although there is almost certainly no direct link between the events described in Beowulf and the burial, the same world of traditions and ideas inspired them. In both cases there is a notion that death includes a journey to the hereafter and that the deceased must be interred with objects from the world of the living, such as weapons, money, drinking horns, and musical instruments. The burial at Sutton Hoo, like those of confirmed Viking burials, shows a well-developed notion of the afterlife. Who then was buried in the boat at Sutton Hoo? No body has yet been found\u2014perhaps because the acidic soil long ago dissolved it, although scholars point out that human remains have been found elsewhere at the site. One mainstream theory is that the burial belonged to R\u00e6dwald, King of East Anglia, who died in 624, and whose reign coincides with the dates of the Sutton Hoo treasure. R\u00e6dwald was one of the first Angle kings to convert to Christianity, and although the ship contains pagan elements, academics do not see this as a reason to rule him out. He lived at a time in which ancient customs coexisted with new religious ideas, a fascinating period in which northern Europe\u2019s pagan tradition was beginning to give way to the new world of Christianity. 1926Edith Pretty buys the site of Sutton Hoo, and becomes fascinated by the strange mounds of earth on her land. 1939Basil Brown discovers a funerary cache of 263 objects in tumulus 1. World War II breaks out in September. 1946After being kept safe underground during the war, the treasure\u2014owned by the British Museum\u2014is put on public display. 1990sFurther excavations uncover another intact burial site in tumulus 17 containing a young man, a horse, and weapons.

Popularized by the movie Indiana Jones, Rome's ancient catacombs are tinged with mystery. A cross inlaid in the floor of a library marks the spot where Indiana Jones has to dig to access the ancient catacombs of Venice in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The catacombs, a network of dark and narrow underground tunnels and tombs, hold the secret that eventually leads Indy to the hideout of the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, the dramatic scene is fictional.  \"There are no catacombs in Venice, as the town rises on wood piles in the middle of the saltwater Venetian Lagoon. There is no room for underground chambers or passages, and only a few buildings have a basement,\" says Luigi Fozzati, head of the Archaeological Superintendence of Veneto. In fact, Venice's cemetery is located on a small island outside the town, and the oldest tombs of nobles and heads of state lie aboveground in churches. To find catacombs, go to Rome, home of some of the oldest and longest burial underground tunnels in the world. \"Hundreds of kilometers of catacombs run underneath the town and its outskirts,\" says Adriano Morabito, president of the association Roma Sotterranea (Underground Rome).  \"Some of the networks are well known and open to visitors, while others are still scarcely explored. Probably there are a number of lost catacombs, too.\" The oldest tunnels date back to the first century. \"The Jewish community in Rome built them as cemeteries. Christian catacombs came a century later. They were not secret meeting places to survive persecutions, as historians thought in the past, but burial tunnels, like the Jewish ones,\" Morabito explains. \"They used to grow larger and larger around the tombs of saints because people asked to be buried near their religious leaders.\" All Christian catacombs in Rome are property of the Catholic Church, and no one is allowed to explore them without special permission from the Vatican.  \"It's not so easy to get the permission. That's one of the reasons there have been very few archaeological expeditions to less known tunnels in the last decades,\" Morabito says. The aura of mystery surrounding the catacombs has fed legends for centuries. Recently, Alfredo Barbagallo, an amateur archaeologist, claimed that the Holy Grail could be hidden in Rome, in the catacomb underneath the Basilica of San Lorenzo Fuori le Mura, near the tomb of St. Lawrence, a deacon martyred in A.D. 258. According to a legend, Pope Sixtus II entrusted the Holy Grail to Lawrence to save it from the persecution of Emperor Valerian. The deacon put the chalice in a safe place\u2014and perhaps even sent it to Spain\u2014before being killed. Barbagallo thinks the Grail never left Rome and is currently buried in a tunnel under the basilica dedicated to St. Lawrence. Vatican authorities denied permission to open the catacomb and look for the chalice.  \"There isn't any solid evidence behind Barbagallo's claims,\" says Vincenzo Fiocchi Nicolai, rector of the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archaeology.

        "title": "Rival to Egypt, the Nubian kingdom of Kush exuded power and gold",
        "text": "Adorned with tall, slender pyramids, the wealthy Nile city of Mero\u00eb was the seat of power of Kush, an ancient kingdom and rival to Egypt. Rising high in the sky in the modern-day nation of Sudan is a plethora of pyramids. They mark the site of the ancient city Mero\u00eb, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The center of a powerful civilization, Mero\u00eb served as the capital city of Kush whose robust culture thrived for centuries. Their grand architecture and works of art left a lasting testament to the greatness of the Nubian kings and queens. Located in the desert sands near the Nile in modern Sudan, the ancient culture of Nubia played a decisive role in shaping Egypt from the eighth century B.C., serving as that kingdom\u2019s 25th dynasty in the Late Period. After the Nubian pharaohs lost power, they retreated south from Egypt to form the Kingdom of Kush, which thrived in splendid isolation as the rest of Egypt suffered through repeated invasions from Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks. Because of Mero\u00eb\u2019s distance, the Kushites were able to retain their independence, developing their own vibrant hybrid of Egyptian culture and religion until well into the fourth century A.D. With access to mines and minerals, the Meroites were expert goldworkers. They built temples, palaces, and royal baths in their capital. Perhaps their grandest achievements are the more than 200 pyramids built at the necropolis at Mero\u00eb, giving Sudan more pyramids than all of Egypt. Tall, slender, graceful: These monuments bear witness to the lasting splendor that was Kush. In the late 20th century A.D. Swiss archaeologist Charles Bonnet spent decades excavating the lands surrounding the southern Nile. He found evidence of a civilization grown rich from trade and abundant with fields and livestock, a kingdom distinct from Egypt with its own material culture and traditions. This civilization grew in power just as Egypt\u2019s Middle Kingdom was in decline around 1785 B.C. By 1500 B.C., the Nubian empire roughly stretched from Wadi Halfa south to Mero\u00eb. Centered on its original capital at Napata, the Nubian ruling dynasty continued to flourish militarily and economically through the ninth century B.C. Around 730 B.C., the Nubian king, Piye, successfully invaded and conquered Egypt, extending his control to the whole Nile Valley. Piye became the first pharaoh of Egypt\u2019s 25th dynasty (ca 770-656 B.C.), the so-called Black Pharaohs. Ono of the most remarkable features of Meroitic civilization was its strong queens. In his Geography, Greek historian Strabo wrote of a queen called \u201cCandace\u201d who signed a peace treaty with the emperor Augustus. Candace, in fact, means \u201csister,\u201d and was the title given to Kushite queens. There were many queens in Meroe\u0308, such as Amanirenas\u2014the \u201cCandace\u201d Strabo was referring to\u2014and her successor, Amanishakheto, whose treasure was looted in 1834. Archaeologists have recently been studying the funerary chamber of another queen, Khennuwa, whose tomb was excavated by George Reisner in 1922.  Piye died in 715 B.C., having reigned 35 years. Although he had returned to Nubia after conquering Egypt, he wished to be buried in the Egyptian style, a request his subjects granted. Entombed in a pyramid, Piye was the first pharaoh in more than 500 years to be buried this way. The 25th dynasty would last for three-quarters of a century. Its reign ended in turmoil when an Assyrian invasion of Egypt caused it to fall from power. The victors struck the names of the 25th dynasty from monuments across Egypt, destroying their statues and stelae to erase their names from history. After the defeat, the Nubians retreated to Napata, only to be forced farther south at the beginning of the sixth century B.C., when Pharaoh Psamtek II, part of the 26th dynasty, sacked Napata. The Kushites designated the city of Mero\u00eb, which sat farther south along the Nile, as the new capital. This new location was carefully considered. Not only strategically positioned at the crossroads of inland African trade routes and caravan trails from the Red Sea, the land around Mero\u00eb was also fertile and blessed with significant natural resources\u2014iron and gold mines that fostered the development of a metals industry, especially goldworking. The Kushites\u2019 burial culture had been touched by a synthesis of Egyptian and African religious and cultural practices. Even after relocating south, the Kushite kings continued to be buried in the necropolis at Nuri, near Napata, a center of the cult of the Egyptian god Amun. Ages 7-12 Mero\u00eb would become the preferred necropolis later, around 250 B.C. There are two main burial areas: the south cemetery and the northern burial ground. The south cemetery was the oldest. When it reached capacity, the northern burial ground was begun. The northern area today contains the best preserved of the pyramids at Meroe\u0308. Some of the most impressive tombs here are the final resting places for 30 kings, eight queens, and three princes. Mero\u00eb\u2019s earliest pyramids were step pyramids. Scholars have speculated that cylinders or spheres may have once topped the pyramids, made of materials that have since been destroyed or perished. The later structures, built in the third century A.D., are simpler with smooth, steep sides. In spite of the clear influence of the classic Egyptian design, Mero\u00eb\u2019s pyramids are notably smaller and generally lack the pyramidion, a pointed capstone. Their design more closely resembles the chapel pyramids built at Deir el Medina near Luxor. These were built during Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom period (1539-1075 B.C.), a period when many Egyptian customs began to appear in Kushite culture. The stones were set in place with a shaduf, or shaft, a device used as a lever to raise stone blocks. The outside was faced with brick and then covered with brightly painted plaster. Steps were carved into the rock to the east of each pyramid leading down to a sealed entrance. Behind it lay underground rooms with vaulted ceilings: three for a king and two for a queen. In the oldest pyramids, the burial chamber was decorated with scenes from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. A wooden coffin, depicting the dead person\u2019s face, was placed in the burial chamber. The sacrificed bodies of animals and, in some cases, of human servants were placed nearby. Attached to one side of a standard Mero\u00eb pyramid was a chapel, its entrance formed by twin tapering pylons. Inside, it was common to place a stela, an offering table, and a distinctive element of Mero\u00eb culture: a statue of the ba\u2014the aspect of the human soul believed to give the deceased their individuality\u2014depicted as the body of a bird and a human head. Kush prospered for centuries, but Queen Cleopatra\u2019s death in 30 B.C. brought change. Egypt became a province of the nascent Roman Empire, straining the fragile truce that the Kushites had brokered with Rome. Tax revolts in Upper Egypt led to Roman incursions into Kushite territory, threatening their lucrative gold mines.

Mero\u00eb was abandoned in the fourth century A.D. Over the centuries, rumors spread of its monuments and the gold they contained, eventually reaching the Italian tomb robber Giuseppe Ferlini. In 1834 Ferlini arrived in Mero\u00eb, where he set about looting the graves. The damage Ferlini caused is still lamented by archaeologists, but the few exquisite artifacts he brought back opened the eyes of European scholars to this mysterious culture that had absorbed the ancient traditions of pharaonic Egypt.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text:\n\nRising high in the sky in the modern-day nation of Sudan is a plethora of pyramids. They mark the site of the ancient city Mero\u00eb, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The center of a powerful civilization, Mero\u00eb served as the capital city of Kush whose robust culture thrived for centuries. Their grand architecture and works of art left a lasting testament to the greatness of the Nubian kings and queens.\n\nLocated in the desert sands near the Nile in modern Sudan, the ancient culture of Nubia played a decisive role in shaping Egypt from the eighth century B.C., serving as that kingdom\u2019s 25th dynasty in the Late Period. After the Nubian pharaohs lost power, they retreated south from Egypt to form the Kingdom of Kush, which thrived in splendid isolation as the rest of Egypt suffered through repeated invasions from Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks.\n\nBecause of Mero\u00eb\u2019s distance, the Kushites were able to retain their independence, developing their own vibrant hybrid of Egyptian culture and religion until well into the fourth century A.D. With access to mines and minerals, the Meroites were expert goldworkers. They built temples, palaces, and royal baths in their capital. Perhaps their grandest achievements are the more than 200 pyramids built at the necropolis at Mero\u00eb, giving Sudan more pyramids than all of Egypt.\n\nTall, slender, graceful: These monuments bear witness to the lasting splendor that was Kush. In the late 20th century A.D. Swiss archaeologist Charles Bonnet spent decades excavating the lands surrounding the southern Nile. He found evidence of a civilization grown rich from trade and abundant with fields and livestock, a kingdom distinct from Egypt with its own material culture and traditions.\n\nThis civilization grew in power just as Egypt\u2019s Middle Kingdom was in decline around 1785 B.C. By 1500 B.C., the Nubian empire roughly stretched from Wadi Halfa south to Mero\u00eb. Centered on its original capital at Napata, the Nubian ruling dynasty continued to flourish militarily and economically through the ninth century B.C. Around 730 B.C., the Nubian king, Piye, successfully invaded and conquered Egypt, extending his control to the whole Nile Valley.\n\nPiye became the first pharaoh of Egypt\u2019s 25th dynasty (ca 770-656 B.C.), the so-called Black Pharaohs. Ono of the most remarkable features of Meroitic civilization was its strong queens. In his Geography, Greek historian Strabo wrote of a queen called \u201cCandace\u201d who signed a peace treaty with the emperor Augustus. Candace, in fact, means \u201csister,\u201d and was the title given to Kushite queens.\n\nThere were many queens in Meroe\u0308, such as Amanirenas\u2014the \u201cCandace\u201d Strabo was referring to\u2014and her successor, Amanishakheto, whose treasure was looted in 1834. Archaeologists have recently been studying the funerary chamber of another queen, Khennuwa, whose tomb was excavated by George Reisner in 1922.\n\nPiye died in 715 B.C., having reigned 35 years. Although he had returned to Nubia after conquering Egypt, he wished to be buried in the Egyptian style, a request his subjects granted. Entombed in a pyramid, Piye was the first pharaoh in more than 500 years to be buried this way. The 25th dynasty would last for three-quarters of a century. Its reign ended in turmoil when an Assyrian invasion of Egypt caused it to fall from power.\n\nThe victors struck the names of the 25th dynasty from monuments across Egypt, destroying their statues and stelae to erase their names from history. After the defeat, the Nubians retreated to Napata, only to be forced farther south at the beginning of the sixth century B.C., when Pharaoh Psamtek II, part of the 26th dynasty, sacked Napata. The Kushites designated the city of Mero\u00eb, which sat farther south along the Nile, as the new capital.\n\nThis new location was carefully considered. Not only strategically positioned at the crossroads of inland African trade routes and caravan trails from the Red Sea, the land around Mero\u00eb was also fertile and blessed with significant natural resources\u2014iron and gold mines that fostered the development of a metals industry, especially goldworking.\n\nThe Kushites\u2019 burial culture had been touched by a synthesis of Egyptian and African religious and cultural practices. Even after relocating south, the Kushite kings continued to be buried in the necropolis at Nuri, near Napata, a center of the cult of the Egyptian god Amun.

        "title": "How the Parthenon Lost Its Marbles",
        "text": "In 1801 a British nobleman stripped the Parthenon of many of its sculptures and took them to England. Controversy over their acquisition by the British Museum continues to this day. Was it preservation, or pillage? During the 1700s, a European Grand Tour was a rite of passage for the sons of wealthy families. Lasting for up to three years, and taking in Switzerland, Paris, and Rome, the high point of this secular pilgrimage for most travelers was Greece. On arriving in Athens, the first sight these young tourists would look for was the Acropolis and its crowning glory: the pillared Parthenon, dedicated to the warrior goddess Athena. Yet even as the Grand Tour became increasingly popular, laying the foundations for modern tourism, this great monument, studded with the work of the great Athenian sculptor Phidias, was at risk of disappearing entirely. Since the 15th century, Greece had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire, whose troops had converted the Acropolis into a garrison, and whose sultan, Mehmed II, had turned the Parthenon itself into a mosque, complete with a minaret. In 1687, during a war fought between Venice and the Ottomans, the great monument was used by the Ottomans to store gunpowder. Exposed on the Acropolis, the Parthenon was a highly vulnerable target, and in September that year, a deadly blow fell: A Venetian mortar struck it, causing a colossal explosion that destroyed its roof, leaving only the pediments standing. Later, the Venetian admiral Francesco Morosini tried to remove sculptures in order to take them back to Venice. The pulley he was using broke, and the figures, including a large Poseidon, was smashed to pieces. Morosini withdrew from Athens with the dubious of honor of having caused more damage to the Parthenon in just one year than it had suffered in the two millennia since Socrates and Pericles had watched its slow rise over Athens at the end of the fifth century B.C. By the middle of the 18th century yet more of the ruined Parthenon\u2019s decoration had been plundered. The site\u2019s precariousness only encouraged travelers to carry off items, as many believed it would be razed to the ground before long anyway. \u201cIt is to be regretted that so much admirable sculpture as is still extant about this fabric should be all likely to perish ... from ignorant contempt and brutal violence\u201d warned Richard Chandler, an English antiquarian, in 1770. A few years later, the Irish painter Edward Dodwell reported that huge quantities of marble from the Parthenon had been broken up in order to build cabins for a garrison. On hearing about the situation, many western travelers and collectors sought to acquire treasures pillaged from the Parthenon on the local black market in an attempt to \u201csave\u201d them from destruction. Some collectors claimed this was perfectly legal, as they removed items with the connivance of the Ottoman authorities. Many collections of Parthenon statuary housed in the world\u2019s museums today were acquired in this way. The most famous and significant was brought to London beginning in 1803 by the former British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, the nobleman Thomas Bruce\u2014more commonly known as Lord Elgin. Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin and 11th Earl of Kincardine, was an aristocrat with a promising political career. During the first years of the war with revolutionary France, he held various diplomatic posts in Vienna, Brussels, and Berlin. He returned to his native Scotland in 1796, where he built a splendid country mansion at Broomhall. The architect behind the project was Thomas Harrison, who shared his client\u2019s passion for Greek sculpture and architecture. In 1799 Lord Elgin\u2019s diplomatic services were again required\u2014this time as ambassador to the Ottoman sultan Selim III, who was keen to foster allies from Europe who would help him boost his defenses against Napoleon\u2019s campaign in Egypt, then under indirect Ottoman rule. Having married hastily in September 1799, Elgin set sail from Portsmouth with his new wife, the heiress Mary Nisbet, bound for Constantinople (now Istanbul). Before Elgin left, Harrison urged him to use his privileged position to get hold of drawings and copies of Greece\u2019s great monuments. Lord Elgin agreed and enlisted a team of artists directed by the painter Giovanni Battista Lusieri. Ages 7-12 On their arrival, Lord and Lady Elgin were lavishly received by the sultan. While his wife organized sumptuous parties, Lord Elgin sent Lusieri and his team to Athens to sketch ancient works of art, as requested by Harrison. Lusieri was given free rein to carry out his work\u2014except when it came to the Acropolis. In order to gain access to the monument, the Ottomans demanded large daily payments, and they refused to let the painter set up a single piece of scaffolding. Lusieri then asked Lord Elgin to request a firman, a special permission from the sultan himself. On July 6, 1801, Lord Elgin received authorization, not only to survey and take casts of the sculptures but also to remove whatever pieces were of interest to him\u2014or at least that\u2019s how Elgin interpreted this now controversial passage from the sultan: \u201cWhen they wish to take away some pieces of stone with old inscriptions and figures, no opposition be made.\u201d Having won the favor of the governor of Athens, Lusieri and his men dismantled a large part of the frieze from the Parthenon as well as numerous capitals and metopes. Finally in 1803, the huge collection of marbles was packed up into about two hundred boxes, which were then loaded onto wagons and transported to the port of Piraeus to await their passage to England. Any answer to this question, one which has bedeviled British-Greek relations for years, is based on interpretation of the document at the heart of the affair: the firman, the decree issued by Sultan Selim III to Elgin, which was used as a justification to take the marbles. Despite the ambiguity of the language in the firman, the landmark 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, Lord Elgin and the Marbles, concludes that the sultan did not allow the removal and export of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon. A clause authorizing the British to take stones \u201cwith old inscriptions and figures\u201d probably referred to items found in the excavations conducted on the site, not artworks adorning the temples. Later, Elgin and his associates would recognize before the parliamentary committee that this act was probably illegal, but they justified it as a way to save the pieces from the damage and looting to which they had been subjected under Ottoman rule. Romancing the Stones: Elgin\u2019s workmen removed a total of 15 metopes from the Parthenon. They also took 247 feet\u2014just under half\u2014of the total frieze, as well as removing one of the caryatids (female sculptures) from the nearby portico of the Erechtheion, and four fragments from the frieze of the temple to Athena Nike. Transporting the marbles to the United Kingdom was beset with problems from the outset. One of the ships was wrecked near the island of Ky\u0301thira, where the cargo of treasures lay on the seafloor for two years before being retrieved. Hostilities with France, and the possibility of the hoard falling into French hands, led Elgin to request that a British warship docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens take the heaviest sculptures from the Parthenon pediments. Elgin had managed to keep the marbles from the French, but the same could not be said about his own person: Crossing France on his homeward journey to London, he was impris- oned and remained in custody in Pau near the Spanish border for three years until 1806. Once back in London, he began new negotiations to get the Ottoman government to authorize the second shipment of statuary, which left Piraeus in 1809. Having brought the statues and reliefs to England, Lord Elgin proposed putting them on public display\u2014a noble idea that was undermined by his intention to \u201crestore\u201d the statues. Elgin hoped to re-create the missing sections of each piece. To carry this out, he put forward the name of the most important neoclassical sculptor of the time, Antonio Canova. Canova, a Venetian, refused to touch the treasures, protesting: \u201cIt would be a sacrilege for any man to touch them with a chisel.\u201d From 1807, Elgin exhibited the marbles that had arrived in Britain in a house that he leased in Park Lane, near Piccadilly in London. The display was a sensation, attracting a huge number of artists and academics. The costs of shipping the marbles were paid out of Lord Elgin\u2019s own pocket. He calculated he had spent a total of \u00a374,000 in expenses and bribes\u2014more than a million dollars in today\u2019s money. Despite his title, Elgin was not a very rich man, especially after 1808 when he faced a ruinous divorce settlement. Feeling the pinch, he put pressure on the British government to buy the collection. In 1812 he deposited the marbles in the home of the Duke of Devonshire and mobilized his contacts to talk up the value of the pieces and warn against the danger of them falling into foreign hands. In 1816 Parliament created a commission to assess Elgin\u2019s offer, a decision that caused a huge stir in the press. The country was divided among those who considered they should be bought for the nation, those who considered them a waste of money, and those like the poet Byron who excoriated Elgin for taking them in the first place. Negotiations for the sale of the Parthenon sculptures to the British crown unleashed a blazing controversy about the artistic value of the pieces. Should they be bought with public money? And was it even legal to take them out of Greece in the first place? How Much?! The 1816 cartoon by George Cruikshank (above) shows Lord Elgin trying to sell the sculptures to \u201cJohn Bull,\u201d embodying the sober Englishman who thinks that the money needed would be better used to serve the needs of his family. 1. Here\u2019s a bargain for you, Johnny? Only \u00a335,000!! I have bought them on purpose for you! Never think of Bread when you can have Stones so wondrous cheap!! 2. I don\u2019t think somehow that these here Stones are perfect! And had rather not buy them at present. Trade is very Bad and provision very Dear, and my Family can\u2019t Eat Stones! Besides, they say it will cost \u00a340,000 to build a place to put them in\u2014As the Turks gave them to our Ambassador in his Official capacity for little or nothing & solely out of compliment to the British Nation \u2014I think he should not charge such an Enormous price for Packing & Carriage. 3. Don\u2019t buy them, Daddy! We don\u2019t want them Stones. Give us Bread! give us Bread! Give us Bread! 4. Let him take his Stones back again to the Turks. We don\u2019t want them in this Country!! In 1816 the commission finally fixed the price of the marbles at \u00a335,000 (approximately $500,000 in today\u2019s money)\u2014less than half Elgin\u2019s asking price. Parliament approved the sale by a very tight margin: 82 votes in favor and 80 against. Lord Elgin, a staunch patriot, had turned down lucrative offers from other governments for the treasures, and argued all along that the marbles would add luster to Britain\u2019s imperial image. Taking the long view, he was justified in anticipating the sense of national pride Britain would feel for the marbles, and in time it became commonly accepted that the nation had purchased them for a song. One of the greatest artworks in human history was now housed in the middle of London, a vital propaganda tool in projecting the image of the British Empire as civilized and benign. After spending several years in a temporary facility, the marbles were moved to the Elgin Room in the British Museum in 1832. As the exhibition had an educational purpose, providing models for artists, the original pieces were displayed together with molds of the missing fragments. The originals, in fact, made up only around 60 percent of the whole display. In the 1930s work began on a new room that would display only the originals, whose surface texture and color had been altered due to a rigorous (but poorly supervised) cleaning in preparation for display. The Duveen Gallery, named after the businessman who financed it, was completed in 1938 but installation of the marbles was halted by World War II. During the Nazi raids on London, the marbles were put into storage, and the Duveen Gallery itself suffered serious bomb damage. The space was restored and finally opened to the public in 1962. Since regaining independence in 1832, successive Greek governments have petitioned for the return of the Parthenon marbles. During her service as the Greek minister of culture between 1981 and 1989, the actress Melina Mercouri reenergized the repatriation campaign. The new Acropolis Museum of Athens, which opened in 2009, includes a specially designed space to house the marbles for the day\u2014fervently awaited by many Greeks\u2014they are reunited with other treasures from the Parthenon and the Acropolis. Not surprisingly, the British Museum has so far refused all requests to give up one of its most popular exhibits. The Parthenon marbles have become the most visible, and notorious, collection of Acropolis artifacts still housed in museums across Europe, often with the justification that such objects are emblematic of European civilization as a whole, not just of Greek heritage.

Finally in 1803, the huge collection of marbles was packed up into about two hundred boxes, which were then loaded onto wagons and transported to the port of Piraeus to await their passage to England.\n\nAny answer to this question, one which has bedeviled British-Greek relations for years, is based on interpretation of the document at the heart of the affair: the firman, the decree issued by Sultan Selim III to Elgin, which was used as a justification to take the marbles. Despite the ambiguity of the language in the firman, the landmark 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, Lord Elgin and the Marbles, concludes that the sultan did not allow the removal and export of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon.\n\nA clause authorizing the British to take stones \u201cwith old inscriptions and figures\u201d probably referred to items found in the excavations conducted on the site, not artworks adorning the temples. Later, Elgin and his associates would recognize before the parliamentary committee that this act was probably illegal, but they justified it as a way to save the pieces from the damage and looting to which they had been subjected under Ottoman rule.\n\nRomancing the Stones: Elgin\u2019s workmen removed a total of 15 metopes from the Parthenon. They also took 247 feet\u2014just under half\u2014of the total frieze, as well as removing one of the caryatids (female sculptures) from the nearby portico of the Erechtheion, and four fragments from the frieze of the temple to Athena Nike.\n\nTransporting the marbles to the United Kingdom was beset with problems from the outset. One of the ships was wrecked near the island of Ky\u0301thira, where the cargo of treasures lay on the seafloor for two years before being retrieved. Hostilities with France, and the possibility of the hoard falling into French hands, led Elgin to request that a British warship docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens take the heaviest sculptures from the Parthenon pediments.\n\nElgin had managed to keep the marbles from the French, but the same could not be said about his own person: Crossing France on his homeward journey to London, he was imprisoned and remained in custody in Pau near the Spanish border for three years until 1806. Once back in London, he began new negotiations to get the Ottoman government to authorize the second shipment of statuary, which left Piraeus in 1809.\n\nHaving brought the statues and reliefs to England, Lord Elgin proposed putting them on public display\u2014a noble idea that was undermined by his intention to \u201crestore\u201d the statues. Elgin hoped to re-create the missing sections of each piece. To carry this out, he put forward the name of the most important neoclassical sculptor of the time, Antonio Canova. Canova, a Venetian, refused to touch the treasures, protesting: \u201cIt would be a sacrilege for any man to touch them with a chisel.\u201d\n\nFrom 1807, Elgin exhibited the marbles that had arrived in Britain in a house that he leased in Park Lane, near Piccadilly in London. The display was a sensation, attracting a huge number of artists and academics. The costs of shipping the marbles were paid out of Lord Elgin\u2019s own pocket. He calculated he had spent a total of \u00a374,000 in expenses and bribes\u2014more than a million dollars in today\u2019s money.\n\nDespite his title, Elgin was not a very rich man, especially after 1808 when he faced a ruinous divorce settlement. Feeling the pinch, he put pressure on the British government to buy the collection. In 1812 he deposited the marbles in the home of the Duke of Devonshire and mobilized his contacts to talk up the value of the pieces and warn against the danger of them falling into foreign hands.\n\nIn 1816 Parliament created a commission to assess Elgin\u2019s offer, a decision that caused a huge stir in the press. The country was divided among those who considered they should be bought for the nation, those who considered them a waste of money, and those like the poet Byron who excoriated Elgin for taking them in the first place.\n\nNegotiations for the sale of the Parthenon sculptures to the British crown unleashed a blazing controversy about the artistic value of the pieces. Should they be bought with public money? And was it even legal to take them out of Greece in the first place?\n\nThe 1816 cartoon by George Cruikshank shows Lord Elgin trying to sell the sculptures to \u201cJohn Bull,\u201d embodying the sober Englishman who thinks that the money needed would be better used to serve the needs of his family.\n\nIn 1816 the commission finally fixed the price of the marbles at \u00a335,000 (approximately $500,000 in today\u2019s money)\u2014less than half Elgin\u2019s asking price. Parliament approved the sale by a very tight margin: 82 votes in favor and 80 against.\n\nLord Elgin, a staunch patriot, had turned down lucrative offers from other governments for the treasures, and argued all along that the marbles would add luster to Britain\u2019s imperial image. Taking the long view, he was justified in anticipating the sense of national pride Britain would feel for the marbles, and in time it became commonly accepted that the nation had purchased them for a song.\n\nOne of the greatest artworks in human history was now housed in the middle of London, a vital propaganda tool in projecting the image of the British Empire as civilized and benign. After spending several years in a temporary facility, the marbles were moved to the Elgin Room in the British Museum in 1832.\n\nAs the exhibition had an educational purpose, providing models for artists, the original pieces were displayed together with molds of the missing fragments. The originals, in fact, made up only around 60 percent of the whole display. In the 1930s work began on a new room that would display only the originals, whose surface texture and color had been altered due to a rigorous (but poorly supervised) cleaning in preparation for display.\n\nThe Duveen Gallery, named after the businessman who financed it, was completed in 1938 but installation of the marbles was halted by World War II. During the Nazi raids on London, the marbles were put into storage, and the Duveen Gallery itself suffered serious bomb damage. The space was restored and finally opened to the public in 1962.\n\nSince regaining independence in 1832, successive Greek governments have petitioned for the return of the Parthenon marbles. During her service as the Greek minister of culture between 1981 and 1989, the actress Melina Mercouri reenergized the repatriation campaign.\n\nThe new Acropolis Museum of Athens, which opened in 2009, includes a specially designed space to house the marbles for the day\u2014fervently awaited by many Greeks\u2014they are reunited with other treasures from the Parthenon and the Acropolis. Not surprisingly, the British Museum has so far refused all requests to give up one of its most popular exhibits.\n\nThe Parthenon marbles have become the most visible, and notorious, collection of Acropolis artifacts still housed in museums across Europe, often with the justification that such objects are emblematic of European civilization as a whole, not just of Greek heritage."

        "title": "Inside the swift, deadly history of the Spanish Flu pandemic",
        "text": "Before SARS and coronavirus, Spanish flu infected a third of the world\u2019s population and killed as many as 50 million in the waning years of World War I. Chicago theaters displayed posters like this one to slow the spread of the Spanish flu during the 1918 pandemic. Scientist Johan Hultin traveled to Brevig Mission, Alaska, a town of a few hundred souls in the summer of 1997. He was searching for buried bodies, and Alaska\u2019s frozen ground was the perfect place to find them. Digging through the permafrost\u2014with permission from the town\u2019s authorities\u2014he eventually uncovered a woman who died almost 80 years previously and was in a state of excellent preservation. Hultin then extracted samples\u2009of the woman\u2019s lung before reinterring her. He intended to use this to decode the genetic sequence of the virus that had killed this Inuit woman along with 90 percent of the town\u2019s population. Brevig Mission was just one place that was part of a global tragedy, one of the worst ever to befall humanity: the influenza pandemic of 1918-19. The outbreak of this influenza virus, also known as Spanish flu, spread with astonishing speed around the world, overwhelming India, and reaching Australia and the remote Pacific islands. In just 18 months at least a third of the world\u2019s population was infected. Estimates on the exact number of fatalities vary wildly, from 20 million to 50 million to 100 million deaths. If the upper end of that estimate is accurate, the 1918 pandemic killed more people than both World Wars put together. (Get the facts on influenza.) Several closely related viruses cause influenza, but one strain (type A) is linked to deadly epidemics. The 1918-19 pandemic was caused by an influenza A virus known as H1N1. Despite becoming known as the Spanish flu, the first recorded cases were in the United States in the final year of World War I. (Explore the memorials of World War I.) A magnified view of the H1N1 virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic. By March 1918 the United States had been at war with Germany and the Central Powers for 11 months. During that time America\u2019s small, prewar army had grown into a vast fighting force that would eventually send more than two million men to Europe. (How the United States entered World War I.) American forts experienced a massive expansion as the entire nation mobilized for war. One of these was Fort Riley, Kansas, where a new training facility, Camp Funston, was built to house some of the 50,000 men who would be inducted into the Army. It was here in early March that a feverish soldier reported to the infirmary. Within a few hours more than a hundred other soldiers had come down with a similar condition, and more would fall ill over the following weeks. In April more American troops arrived in Europe and brought the virus with them. The first wave of the pandemic had arrived. (What is the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic?) The Spanish flu strain killed its victims with a swiftness never seen before. In the United States stories abounded of people waking up sick and dying on their way to work. The symptoms were gruesome: Sufferers would develop a fever and become short of breath. Lack of oxygen meant their faces appeared tinged with blue. Hemorrhages filled the lungs with blood and caused catastrophic vomiting and nosebleeds, with victims drowning in their own fluids. Unlike so many strains of influenza before it, Spanish flu attacked not only the very young and the very old, but also healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 40. Biologists at St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London are analyzing brain and lung tissue from victims of the 1918 pandemic as part of global efforts to understand the virus. Here, wax-mounted tissue samples sit on a list of children\u2019s names who fell victims to influenza in 1918. The principal factor in the virus\u2019s spread was, of course, the international conflict then in its last phase. Epidemiologists still dispute the exact origins of the virus, but there is some consensus it was the result of a genetic mutation that perhaps took place in China. But what is clear is that the new strain went global thanks to the massive and rapid movement of troops around the world. Ages 7-12 The drama of the war also served to obscure the unusually high mortality rates of the new virus. At this early stage, the illness was not well understood and deaths were often attributed to pneumonia. Strict wartime censorship meant that the European and North American press were unable to report outbreaks. Only in neutral Spain could the press speak freely about what was happening, and it was from this media coverage that the disease took its nickname. Epidemics are as old as civilization: Signs of smallpox appear on 12th-century B.C. Egyptian mummies. Increased contact led to the spread of disease. In the sixth century A.D. the Plague of Justinian moved along trade routes, killing 25 million people across Asia, Africa, Arabia, and Europe. Eight centuries later, the Black Death wiped out 60 percent of Europe\u2019s population. When Europeans settled in the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries, they introduced smallpox, influenza, and measles to the native peoples, killing an estimated 90 percent of the population. Here, Native Americans treat patients infected by European diseases in a 1591 engraving by Theodor de Bry.  The overcrowded trenches and encampments of the First World War became the perfect hosts for the disease. As troops moved, so the infection traveled with them. The wave that had first appeared in Kansas abated after a few weeks, but this was only a temporary reprieve. By September 1918 the epidemic was ready to enter its most lethal phase. It has been calculated that the 13 weeks between September and December 1918 constituted the most intense period, taking the greatest number of lives. At least 195,000 Americans died in October alone. In comparison, total American military casualties for the whole of World War I came in at just over 116,000. Once again, it was the crowded military encampments where the second wave initially gained a hold. In September an outbreak of 6,674 cases was reported at Camp Devens, a military base in Massachusetts. As the crisis reached its zenith, the medical services began to be overwhelmed. Morticians and gravediggers struggled, and conducting individual funerals became impossible. Many of the dead ended up in mass graves. The end of 1918 brought a hiatus in the spread of the illness and January 1919 saw the beginning of the third and final phase. By then the disease was a much diminished force. The ferocity of the autumn and winter of the previous year was not repeated and mortality rates fell. Although the final wave was much less lethal than its predecessors, it was still able to wreak considerable damage. Australia, which had quickly enacted quarantine restrictions, managed to escape the worst of the flu until the beginning of 1919, when the disease finally arrived and took the lives of several thousand Australians. The Spanish flu did not strike in Australia until 1919. Quarantine camps like this one, in Wallangarra, Queensland, were set up to treat and contain the illness. The general trend of mortality, however, was downward. There were cases of deaths from influenza\u2014possibly a different strain\u2014as late as 1920, but by the summer of 1919 health care policies and the natural genetic mutation of the virus brought the epidemic to a close. Even so, its effects, for those left bereaved or suffering long-term health complications, were to last decades. The pandemic left almost no part of the world untouched. In Great Britain 228,000 people died. The United States lost as many as 675,000 people, Japan some 400,000. The south Pacific island of Western Samoa (modern-day Samoa) lost one-fifth of its population. Researchers estimate that in India alone, fatalities totaled between 12 and 17 million. Exact data in the number of deaths is elusive, but global mortality figures are estimated to have been between 10 and 20 percent of those who were infected. In 1997 the samples taken by Johan Hultin from the woman found in the frozen mass grave in Brevig Mission added to scientists\u2019 \u2009knowledge as to how flu viruses mutate and spread. Drugs and improved public hygiene\u2014in conjunction with international institutions such as the World Health Organization and national bodies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States\u2014put the international community in a much better position to meet the challenges of a new outbreak. However, scientists know a lethal mutation could occur at any time, and a century on from the mother of all pandemics, its effects on a crowded, interconnected world would be devastating.

Legend tells of a Muisca king who would cover himself in gold dust during festivals, then dive from a raft into Lake Guatavita. The legend of El Dorado is popular folklore, and even ensnared Sir Walter Raleigh. The lust for gold spans all eras, races, and nationalities. To possess any amount of gold seems to ignite an insatiable desire to obtain more. Through the centuries, this passion gave rise to the enduring tale of a city of gold. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Europeans believed that somewhere in the New World there was a place of immense wealth known as El Dorado. Their searches for this treasure wasted countless lives, drove at least one man to suicide, and put another man under the executioner's ax. \"El Dorado shifted geographical locations until finally it simply meant a source of untold riches somewhere in the Americas,\" says Jim Griffith, a folklorist in Tucson, Arizona. But this place of immeasurable riches hasn't been found. The origins of El Dorado lie deep in South America. And like all enduring legends, the tale of El Dorado contains some scraps of truth. When Spanish explorers reached South America in the early 16th century, they heard stories about a tribe of natives high in the Andes mountains in what is now Colombia. When a new chieftain rose to power, his rule began with a ceremony at Lake Guatavita. Accounts of the ceremony vary, but they consistently say the new ruler was covered with gold dust, and that gold and precious jewels were thrown into the lake to appease a god that lived underwater. The Spaniards started calling this golden chief El Dorado, \"the gilded one.\" The ceremony of the gilded man supposedly ended in the late 15th century when El Dorado and his subjects were conquered by another tribe. But the Spaniards and other Europeans had found so much gold among the natives along the continent's northern coast that they believed there had to be a place of great wealth somewhere in the interior. The Spaniards didn't find El Dorado, but they did find Lake Guatavita and tried to drain it in 1545. They lowered its level enough to find hundreds of pieces of gold along the lake's edge. But the presumed fabulous treasure in the deeper water was beyond their reach. English courtier Sir Walter Raleigh made two trips to Guiana to search for El Dorado. During his second trip in 1617, he sent his son, Watt Raleigh, with an expedition up the Orinoco River. But Walter Raleigh, then an old man, stayed behind at a base camp on the island of Trinidad. The expedition was a disaster, and Watt Raleigh was killed in a battle with Spaniards.  Eric Klingelhofer, an archaeologist at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, is trying to find the site or Raleigh's base camp on Trinidad. He says Walter Raleigh was furious at the survivor who informed him of Watt's death and accused the survivor of letting his son be killed. \"The man goes into his cabin on the ship and kills himself,\" says Klingelhofer. Raleigh returned to England, where King James ordered him beheaded for, among other things, disobeying orders to avoid conflict with the Spanish. The legend of El Dorado endures because \"you want it to be true,\" says Jose Oliver, a lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London. \"I don't think we've ever stopped seeking El Dorado.\" So where is this lost city of gold?

Sancho I, ruler of the kingdom of Le\u0301on in the north of modern-day Spain, was overthrown by rebel nobles in A.D. 958. Their motive, even by the turbulent politics of the day, was an unusual one: The king was unable to fulfill his regal duties with dignity, the rebels said, because he was too fat. The relatives of Sancho acted quickly to restore his power. In an example of the lively interchange of ideas and loyalties in multicultural, medieval Spain, his grandmother, Queen Toda Aznar of the Christian kingdom of Navarra, sought help from another Spanish kingdom deep in Spain\u2019s south: the Muslim Caliphate of Co\u0301rdoba. Queen Toda approached Co\u0301rdoba\u2019s great ruler, the caliph \u2019Abd al-Rahman III, with two bold requests: help with a cure for her grandson\u2019s morbid obesity and military support to regain the throne. The caliph put the first matter in the hands of Hisdai ibn Shaprut, his Jewish physician, who put the Leonese king on a strict diet. Once Sancho slimmed down enough to be able to ride properly, he reclaimed his lost crown with the help of Muslim troops. Physicians from Islamic countries during the late Middle Ages enjoyed great respect. Their reputation was well deserved, for the study and practice of medicine was then led by Muslim societies across their immense territory, which extended from modern-day southern Spain to Iran. Seventh CenturyAfter the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s death in 632, Islam expands beyond Arabia to Persia, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and North Africa. Eighth CenturyCaliph Harun al-Rashid founds the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. The city\u2019s scholars translate many ancient manuscripts and medical texts. Ninth CenturyAl-Razi (Rhazes) is born in Persia. Physician, chemist, and teacher, he writes many important medical works later translated into Latin and Greek. 10th CenturySurgeon Al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) is born in Co\u0301rdoba. Inventor of many medical instruments, he writes the first illustrated surgical book. 11th CenturyIn Baghdad, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) writes the Canon of Medicine, a five-volume work encompassing all known medical knowledge of the time. 12th CenturyIbn Rushd (Averroe\u0308s) is born. Philosopher, astronomer, and physician, he writes a medical encyclopedia known as the Colliget in Latin. 14th CenturyOttoman Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu is born. A surgeon, he creates illustrated works showing the advanced procedures of Muslim medicine. Before the message of the Prophet Muhammad spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula, local medical attitudes were based on the words of the founder of Islam: \u201cMake use of medical treatment, for Allah has not made a disease without appointing a remedy for it, with the exception of one disease: old age.\u201d Early Muslim medicine drew on traditional practices from the region, some dating back to ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Babylon in the third millennium B.C. Traditional natural remedies, such as the use of honey or olive oil, and the use of suction cups (hijama) are still used today in many Islamic countries and around the world to treat ailments. An indicator of health in this early Muslim society was one\u2019s dreams. Muhammad ibn Sirin, working in what is today Iraq, composed a great Arabic work, Tabir al-Anam, on dream interpretation in the eighth century. Its main source was Oneirocritica\u2014The Interpretation of Dreams\u2014written by the Greek author Artemidorus Daldianus some 500 years earlier. In addition to this early form of psychological therapy, rituals and talismans appeared in medical treatises. Islam did not reject these practices outright and \u201cbenign\u201d magic was lawful, provided certain rules were followed. Ages 7-12 In 622 the Prophet Muhammad departed from Mecca for Medina, and that year marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Just two centuries later, his successors, the caliphs, had extended their domains eastward toward Iran and India, and westward along the coast of North Africa and Europe. Although Arabian medicine spread with Islam, its rulers were also keen to absorb the wisdom of other cultures, especially the Greco-Roman culture preserved in Egypt and the Near East. They sought to lay claim to the knowledge of philosophy, technology, and medicine, sometimes referred to as the \u201cscience of the ancients.\u201d As Islam expanded, the cities where Greek science had flourished came under Muslim control. These included Alexandria in Egypt and Edessa in modern-day Turkey. On the eastern bounds of Islam, Gondeshapur in Persia had become a center for Greek medicine and learning after scholars migrated there in A.D. 529, following the decision of the emperor Justinian to close the Academy in Athens. The new Muslim elites who occupied Gondeshapur were determined to revive, absorb, and spread what they saw as this lost learning. They also wanted to build on it. Greek science became the basis for the development of Arabic medicine. The early theoretical basis of Islamic medicine drew on the Greek and Roman theory of humors, attributed to Hippocrates, writing in the fourth century B.C. The system of humors divides human fluids into four basic types: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. The balance between each one determines whether an individual is sick or well. Patients became depressed, for example, because of a surfeit of black bile. The combination, in Greek, of the words for \u201cblack,\u201d melanin, and \u201cbile,\u201d khole, is the root of the word \u201cmelancholy.\u201d Sanguine, phlegmatic, or choleric temperaments likewise suffered from an imbalance in the other humors. Health could be restored by rebalancing them with diets and purges, and explains the importance that Islamic medicine placed on hygiene and diet. Gifted translators gave the Muslims access to these Greek and Latin texts. Scholars such as Yahya ibn Masawayh (known in the West as Ioannis Mesue) and his student, Hunayn ibn Ishaq (known as Johannitius in Latin) produced over 50 translations alone. Both men were Syrian Nestorians, a denomination of Christianity considered heretical in the eastern Roman Empire, and had been forced to flee to Persia. Their ability to speak several languages\u2014including Greek and Syriac (a Semitic language close to Arabic)\u2014was in high demand. In other cities across the new Islamic world, Muslim patrons hired these men. The caliph Al-Ma\u2019mun of the Abbasid dynasty in Baghdad put Hunayn ibn Ishaq in charge of the translators at the city\u2019s famous Bayt al-Hikma, or House of Wisdom.     The most important institution for imparting knowledge about medicine and other disciplines was the madrassa, a school built in, or alongside, a mosque. Many madrassas became highly specialized academies, often with close links to hospitals. Notable hospitals were in Cairo, Harran (in modern-day Turkey), and Baghdad, where students would often visit patients to observe their treatment at the hands of qualified doctors, in much the same way as medical interns and residents do today. A basic part of theoretical training was learning summaries in verse form, such as Avicenna\u2019s Poem of Medicine. There were also question-and-answer drills on medical compendia, such as the Paradise of Wisdom, compiled by Ali ibn Rabban al-Tabari around 850.      By the 900s, drawing from a growing body of Greek, Persian, and Sanskrit works translated into Arabic, Islamic medicine quickly became the most sophisticated in the world. Christians, Jews, Hindus, and scholars from many other traditions, looked to Arabic as a language of science. Doctors of different faiths worked together, debating and studying with Arabic as the common tongue. The Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad enjoyed a long period of intellectual experimentation that lasted throughout the 10th and 11th centuries. Among its many glittering figures was Al-Razi, known in Latin as Rhazes, a Persian pharmacologist and physician who ran the hospital in Baghdad. But the brightest star in the Baghdad firmament was undoubtedly the extraordinary Ibn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna. Already a doctor at age 18, his great volume Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb\u2014Canon of Medicine\u2014became one of the most famous medical works of all time, and an extraordinary exercise in the bringing together of different disciplines and cultures. Avicenna\u2019s attempt to harmonize the medical practices of the Greek thinker Galen with the philosophy of Aristotle reveals the multiple nature of the debt owed to Muslim scholarship, which did not merely revive Greek authors, but stimulated new patterns of thought for the centuries ahead. The reconciling of practical science, thought, and religion ensured Canon was studied by European medics until the 18th century. At the westernmost limits of the Islamic world, Muslim Spain was also undergoing a period of scholarly development. By the 10th century, Co\u0301rdoba was the biggest, most cultured city in Europe, described by some as \u201cthe Ornament of the World.\u201d The city was also a great center of study and exploration. Essential volumes in any scientist\u2019s library were preserved in Co\u0301rdoba. For instance, De materia medica\u2014On Medical Material\u2014the classic treatise of Dioscorides, written at the time of the emperor Nero in the first century A.D., was translated into Arabic in Co\u0301rdoba, on the orders of Caliph \u2019Abd al-Rahman III. This practical study of the medicinal qualities of plants and herbs, including a study of cannabis and peppermint, was now accessible to more scholars than ever before.     Sexual intercourse is an important part of marriage in the Muslim faith, and medical works on the subject reflect that belief. A genre of medieval text known as kitab al-bah\u2014books on the libido\u2014explored both reproduction and eroticism as well as embryology, obstetrics, and pediatrics. Issues of sexual health were also addressed, with attention given to sexual disorders, impotence, and loss of desire. Authors also covered aphrodisiacs and substances that decreased libido. These treatises fascinated the British traveler and scholar Richard F. Burton, who collected copies for study in Britain. Burton also translated the great Mideastern classic One Thousand and One Nights, a work whose sexual frankness delighted lovers of Arabic culture\u2014but scandalized Victorian England.     One of the caliph\u2019s brilliant courtiers, the surgeon Al-Zahrawi, also known as Abulcasis, compiled the Al-Tasrif\u2014The Method of Medicine\u2014a 30-volume encyclopedia that documented accounts of his and his colleagues\u2019 experiences in treating the sick and injured: surgical instruments, operating techniques, pharmacological methods to prepare tablets and drugs to protect the heart, surgical procedures used in midwifery, cauterizing and healing wounds, and the treatment of headaches. It also drew upon the work of previous scholars, such as seventh-century Byzantine medic Paul of Aegina. Translated into Latin in the 12th century, Method was a foundational medical text in Europe well into the Renaissance. The 12th century saw the emergence of the work of the outstanding Ibn Rushd\u2014known in Christendom as Averroe\u0308s\u2014and the Jewish physician and thinker Moses Maimonides. Both men reflect the strong ties between philosophy and medicine during the Islamic golden age. Averroe\u0308s, author of some of the greatest commentaries of the Middle Ages on Aristotle and Plato, was also personal physician to the caliphs. Moses Maimonides became the personal doctor of Saladin, the Muslim champion against the Crusaders. Among Maimonides\u2019s many works was his Moreh Nevukhim, or Guide for the Perplexed, a masterwork attempting to reconcile religious belief with philosophical inquiry. While writing about medicine predominated in Islamic culture, the practice of medicine made great progress as well. New treatments were developed for specific ailments, including a revolutionary treatment to treat cataracts. The 10th-century physician Al-Mawsili developed a hollow syringe to remove cataracts via suction; the technique has improved with time, but the basic premise of the procedure remains sound to this day. Ibn Isa, a 10th-century scholar from Iraq, wrote perhaps what was the most complete book of eye diseases, the Notebook of the Oculist, detailing 130 conditions. The book was translated into Latin in 1497 followed by several more languages, allowing it to serve as an authoritative work for centuries. The greatest advances in surgery of the era were detailed by Al-Zahrawi who invented a wide range of instruments: forceps, pincers, scalpels, catheters, cauteries, lancets, and specula, all carefully illustrated in his writings. His recommendations on pain-reduction techniques, such as the use of very cold sponges, were followed by Western medics for centuries. One of his greatest innovations was the use of catgut for stitching up patients after an operation, a practice that is still in use today. One of the most lasting contributions of Islam was the hospital. Funded by donations called waqf, public hospitals treated the sick, provided a place to convalesce and recover, housed the mentally ill, and provided shelter to the aged and infirm. Jewish and Christian doctors, in addition to Muslim physicians, worked in these institutions. Hospitals allowed the poorest to benefit from the knowledge of outstanding doctors: Beggars in Baghdad might be operated on by Rhazes, the great surgeon of the city hospital. As was increasingly the case in Christian Europe, great cities in the Muslim world competed to house such institutions, hoping to attract the best teachers and books. The Ahmad ibn Tulun Hospital, one of the first of its kind, was built in Cairo between 872 and 874. Perhaps the best known hospital of the Islamic world, Al-Mansuri Hospital, was also built in Cairo, by the sultan Qalawun in 1285. Four wards, each one specializing in different pathologies, were reputed to house thousands of patients. The buildings surrounded a courtyard cooled by fountains. Study and education were also important components of Muslim medical culture, and hospitals affiliated with universities educated the next generation of physicians. Founded in the 12th century, the Syrian Al-Nuri Hospital in Damascus was one of the leading medical schools of its time, complete with an impressive library donated by the ruler Nur al-Din ibn Zangi. Much like medical students of today, scholars learned from mentoring by experienced doctors. Hospitals featured large lecture halls where talks and readings of classic manuscripts would be held. The teachings at these universities provided the foundation for the great medical advances to come, which all stand on the shoulders of the extraordinary discoveries and practices from Islam\u2019s golden age.

        "title": "The true story of the 'lost city' made famous by Indiana Jones",
        "text": "The city of Tanis is relatively unknown among Egypt's wealth of historical sites, though it yielded one of the greatest archeological troves ever found. Once the capital of all Egypt, Tanis's royal tombs have yielded artifacts on par with the treasures of Tutankhamun. In \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d the city of Tanis had been buried by an ancient sandstorm and rediscovered by Nazis searching for the Ark of the Covenant.\u00a0 The treasures found in the \"lost city\" of Tanis rival those of King Tut's. Yet for more than six decades the riches from its rulers' tombs have remained largely unknown. Many who know of Tanis at all remember the city as portrayed in the Indiana Jones movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the famous film the city was buried by a catastrophic ancient sandstorm and rediscovered by Nazis searching for the Ark of the Covenant. In reality, the Ark was never hidden in Tanis, the sandstorm didn't happen, and the Nazis never battled Indiana Jones in the site's ruins. But the true tale of Tanis is also fit for the silver screen. Tanis was known by many names. Ancient Egyptians called it Djanet, and the Old Testament refers to the site as Zoan. Today it's called S\u00e2n el-Hagar. The site, in the Nile Delta northeast of Cairo, was capital of the 21st and 22nd dynasties, during the reign of the Tanite kings in Egypt's Third Intermediate period. The city's advantageous location enabled it to become a wealthy commercial center long before the rise of Alexandria. But political fortunes shifted, and so did the river's waters\u2014and in recent centuries the Tanis site had became a silted plain with some hill-like mounds thought to be of little interest. It was known that the ancient city was hidden somewhere in the area, but not where. \"People kept trying to identify different places with it,\" said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at American University in Cairo and a National Geographic Society grantee. Egypt's \"intermediate periods\" were times of weak central government when power was divided and sometimes passed out of Egyptian hands. During this time the rulers of Tanis were of Libyan decent, not scions of traditional Egyptian families. That distinction may have contributed to the city's disappearance in later years. \"It's not like the Valley of the Kings, where everyone knew they'd been burying [pharaohs] for ten generations or so,\" said David Silverman, an Egyptologist at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1939 a French archaeologist named Pierre Montet brought Tanis into the 20th century after nearly a dozen years of excavations. He unearthed a royal tomb complex that included three intact and undisturbed burial chambers\u2014a rare and marvelous find. The tombs held dazzling funereal treasures such as golden masks, coffins of silver, and elaborate sarcophagi. Other precious items included bracelets, necklaces, pendants, tableware, and amulets. Statues, vases, and jars also filled the tombs, all part of an array that still bears witness, after thousands of years, to the power and wealth of Tanis's rulers. One of the kings, Sheshonq II, was unknown before Montet discovered his burial chamber. But he wore elaborate jewelry that once adorned the more famous Sheshonq I, who is mentioned in the Bible. \"That shows you that [the kings of Tanis] were very important at least during that time period,\" Silverman said of the biblical reference.

        "onlytext": "Here is the article text only:\n\nOnce the capital of all Egypt, Tanis's royal tombs have yielded artifacts on par with the treasures of Tutankhamun. In reality, the Ark was never hidden in Tanis, the sandstorm didn't happen, and the Nazis never battled Indiana Jones in the site's ruins. But the true tale of Tanis is also fit for the silver screen. Tanis was known by many names. Ancient Egyptians called it Djanet, and the Old Testament refers to the site as Zoan. Today it's called S\u00e2n el-Hagar. The site, in the Nile Delta northeast of Cairo, was capital of the 21st and 22nd dynasties, during the reign of the Tanite kings in Egypt's Third Intermediate period. The city's advantageous location enabled it to become a wealthy commercial center long before the rise of Alexandria. But political fortunes shifted, and so did the river's waters\u2014and in recent centuries the Tanis site had became a silted plain with some hill-like mounds thought to be of little interest. It was known that the ancient city was hidden somewhere in the area, but not where. \"People kept trying to identify different places with it,\" said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at American University in Cairo and a National Geographic Society grantee. Egypt's \"intermediate periods\" were times of weak central government when power was divided and sometimes passed out of Egyptian hands. During this time the rulers of Tanis were of Libyan decent, not scions of traditional Egyptian families. That distinction may have contributed to the city's disappearance in later years. \"It's not like the Valley of the Kings, where everyone knew they'd been burying [pharaohs] for ten generations or so,\" said David Silverman, an Egyptologist at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1939 a French archaeologist named Pierre Montet brought Tanis into the 20th century after nearly a dozen years of excavations. He unearthed a royal tomb complex that included three intact and undisturbed burial chambers\u2014a rare and marvelous find. The tombs held dazzling funereal treasures such as golden masks, coffins of silver, and elaborate sarcophagi. Other precious items included bracelets, necklaces, pendants, tableware, and amulets. Statues, vases, and jars also filled the tombs, all part of an array that still bears witness, after thousands of years, to the power and wealth of Tanis's rulers. One of the kings, Sheshonq II, was unknown before Montet discovered his burial chamber. But he wore elaborate jewelry that once adorned the more famous Sheshonq I, who is mentioned in the Bible. \"That shows you that [the kings of Tanis] were very important at least during that time period,\" Silverman said of the biblical reference. Tanis was found largely as it was abandoned, so the city is home to many archaeological treasures in addition to the tombs. Temples, including a Temple of Amun and a Temple of Horus, have been found. Even urban districts of the ancient city remain, and the site continues to host archaeological expeditions in search of more finds.

        "title": "Palenque Prized for Unlocking Maya Mysteries",
        "text": "The Maya ruins of Palenque sit in the mist-shrouded jungles of eastern Mexico. The Temple of the Inscriptions, shown here, is the site's most impressive structure. Deep within the temple is an ornate, vaulted chamber containing the crypt of the ruler Pacal. The first published account of this lost city was in 1567, from a Spaniard, Father Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada. Exploring near the Usumacinta River, located in the modern Mexican state of Chiapas, Lorenzo came upon its stone temples and plazas, originally decorated with blue- and red-painted stucco but by then long abandoned by the Maya who built it. Lorenzo gave the grand structure the name Palenque, a Spanish word meaning \"fortification.\" 500 years later, Palenque\u2014one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico\u2014is a modern wellspring from which researchers have drawn some of the most detailed information about Maya culture. It wasn't large, surpassed in size by cities like Calakmul and Tikal, say experts. In 2003, David Stuart of Harvard's Peabody Museum reported that Palenque supported no more than 6,220 people at its peak. But Palenque is prized for something else. \"The main point of interest about Palenque is not its size and [or] age, as other sites are larger and likely much older,\" says Michael D. Carrasco, an assistant professor of art history at Florida State University. \"Its importance lies rather in its naturalistic sculpture, architectural inventiveness, and detailed epigraphic record.\" Researchers say Palenque dates to the Early Classic (A.D. 200-600) period, but most knowledge about the city comes from the Classic period (A.D. 600-900). Palenque's wealth of epigraphy (inscriptions) and recorded history has helped archaeologists to build the first time line of rulers of a Maya city\u2014one that, while impressive, is still fuzzy in places. Carrasco says the Palenque known to modernity is the product of a limited number of rulers, starting with Pakal the Great (603-683), his son, K'inich Kan Bahlam (635-702), and K'inich Akul Mo' Naab (678-736). This succession of kings commissioned the Temple of the Cross Group, Temple XIX, and the Temple of Inscriptions, said to be one of the most profuse sources of glyphic text from the Maya world. It maps nearly 200 years of Palenque's history. The three rulers also commissioned lengthy glyphic texts, which researchers have used to tease apart Maya script. Much scientific debt is owned to Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier, who in 1952 rolled away a stone inside the Temple of Inscriptions and found the burial tomb of Pakal the Great. This has since become one of the most extensively studied archaeological sites in the Americas. David Freidel, a Maya specialist from Southern Methodist University, says the tomb contains Pakal's sarcophagus, upon which is etched the image of \"a handsome youth, the maize god, preparing to ascend into the sky along the cosmic World Tree.\" Since 2004, Friedel says, researchers working at Palenque have discovered three royal tombs, a tomb of sacrifices, offerings to a royal, and a high noble's tomb. Records at the site suggest the site came under attack by another Maya center, Calakmul, in 599 and again in 611. \"This attack was the beginning of or perhaps catalyst for the building campaigns of Pakal and later kings,\" says Carrasco. It was after the second attack that 12-year-old Pakal became ruler, setting in motion a vast rebuilding of Palenque from 615 to 683, one that would be continued by two later rulers: his son, K'inich Kan Bahlam, and Akul Mo' Naab, thought to be Pakal's grandson. In 711, Palenque was sacked by the realm of Tonin\u00e1. Though Temple XIX was built after that attack, still under the reign of Akul Mo' Naab, the event shifted Palenque's ruling dynamics, perhaps prompting a dissolution of concentrated power and replacing it with a shared arrangement between nobles and the king. The construction of elite building stopped after 800, and a gradual population decline ensued. By the time the Spanish got to Chiapas in the 16th century, the Maya had abandoned the city.

        "text": "Conceived in fear and prejudice in the 1800s, the short-lived Know-Nothing Party's intolerance toward German and Irish immigrants led to violence across the young nation. The United States has long conceived of itself as a haven for immigrants, a place welcoming of any person, no matter their origin, to begin a new life as an American. Flying in the face of this ideal, an ugly strain of nativism has run throughout American history as evidenced by virulent anti-immigrant movements that reared up in the 1790s, 1870s, and 1920s. Perhaps the most well-known nativist movement arose in the decades before the Civil War. The American Party, better known as the Know-Nothings, was a reflection of the troubled times confronting the young United States. The nation faced growing conflict over slavery and westward expansion, which led to dissent within the two major political parties, the Democrats and the Whigs. Nativist cartoons from the 1840s and '50s often used ethnic stereotypes to depict Irish and German immigrants as national threats to the United States. Here, they are depicted as drunken election stealers, as shown by the barrels of whiskey and beer and purloined ballot box. \u00a0 In the 1830s and \u201940s increasing numbers of immigrants, mostly Irish in the East and Germans in the Midwest, were settling in the United States. The Irish Potato Famine and economic instability in Germany led to an influx of nearly three million people, a great number of whom were Catholic. Native-born Protestants, mostly in urban areas, felt threatened by the new arrivals in several areas. To many Protestants, the Catholic Church represented tyranny and potential subjugation to a foreign power. On a practical level, competition for jobs increased as new laborers arrived. As anti-immigrant and anti\u2013Roman Catholic feelings arose, nativist groups began to form in cities across the United States. (Explore the past 200 years of U.S. immigration.) Many of these organizations played on fears that foreigners were gaining undue political influence because of the efforts of unscrupulous politicians to woo them and \u201csteal\u201d elections. Nativists often played on stereotypes depicting Irish and Germans as immoral drunkards and often blamed them for social ills, such as rising crime and poverty rates. Tensions sometimes ignited violence, with nativist riots breaking out during the 1840s and \u201950s in New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Louisville. (See how the United States continues to grapple with anxieties surrounding diversity and immigration.) In May and July 1844 anti-immigrant violence rocked the City of Brotherly Love. Originating over whether Catholic children should sing Protestant hymns at school, riots exploded after nativists demonstrated against Catholics in an Irish Catholic neighborhood on May 6. The first riot lasted four days during which two Catholic churches burned and at least 14 people died. Then in July, violence erupted around a Catholic church being protected by the state militia. Nativist rioters pelted them with rocks and bottles, and the militia opened fire. After the smoke cleared hours later, some 15 to 20 people lay dead. \u00a0 In 1849 a secret society named the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner was organized in New York City. Members employed a cloak-and-dagger approach to their political activities; when asked about their organizations, members gave the canned answer: \u201cI know nothing.\u201d Outsiders used this response as a nickname, which stuck. As the Know-Nothings\u2019 membership grew, they would shed their clandestine nature and eventually become the American Party in the 1850s. Party members tended to come from the working classes and had a strong anti-elitist bent. Their platform sought to limit immigration and the influence of Catholicism, and they used ugly ethnic stereotypes to stir up hatred against the recent German and Irish arrivals. Under their plan, residency requirements would increase from five to 21 years before one could become a citizen. People born on foreign soil would not be able to vote or hold public office. On a local level, the Know-Nothings had a large amount of success in a short time, electing mayors and state representatives in the late 1840s and early 1850s. After elections in 1854, they held 43 seats in the U.S. Congress. Much of this early success was due to the demise of the Whig Party, weakened by internal dissent over national issues like slavery. Some former Whigs defected to the Know-Nothings while others joined a new party, the antislavery Republicans. Millard Fillmore, the American Party candidate in 1856, previously served as 13th president of the United States (1850-53). \u00a0 Before 1855, the Know-Nothings had no centralized organization. Encouraged by their successes, they formally organized in 1855 as the American Party, after which they went into a rapid decline. The elections of 1856 were a disaster for their candidates. Their nominee for the presidency, former Whig and president Millard Fillmore, came in a distant third behind the Republicans and the victorious Democrats. The Know-Nothings lost more than 30 seats in Congress. Whatever power they had gained in the early 1850s was gone for good. Winning elections on a national level proved more difficult for the Know-Nothings because of the complexity of the country\u2019s problems. Until 1856, the Know-Nothings had largely been a local movement focused on a single issue. The move to the national stage revealed the fragility of their political alliances, and they tore themselves apart. After 1856, the Republicans would be the party to emerge from the political chaos of the mid-19th century. They would survive the challenges of a nation divided over the question of slavery.

        "title": "Curse of the Mummy",
        "text": "The mummy of King Tut, shown here, gets credit for popularizing the pharaoh's curse, but the myth's origin has been traced to a London stage act performed a hundred years before the boy king's tomb was excavated in 1922. 100-year-old folklore and pop culture have perpetuated the myth that opening a mummy's tomb leads to certain death. Movie mummies are known for two things: fabulous riches and a nasty curse that brings treasure hunters to a bad end. But Hollywood didn't invent the curse concept. The \"mummy's curse\" first enjoyed worldwide acclaim after the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt. When Howard Carter opened a small hole to peer inside the tomb at treasures hidden for 3,000 years, he also unleashed a global passion for ancient Egypt. Tut's glittering treasures made great headlines\u2014especially following the opening of the burial chamber on February 16, 1923\u2014and so did sensationalistic accounts of the subsequent death of expedition sponsor Lord Carnarvon. In reality, Carnarvon died of blood poisoning, and only six of the 26 people present when the tomb was opened died within a decade. Carter, surely any curse's prime target, lived until 1939, almost 20 years after the tomb's opening. But while the pharaoh's curse may lack bite, it hasn't lost the ability to fascinate audiences\u2014which may be how it originated in the first place. The late Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat conducted a comprehensive search and concluded that the concept began with a strange \"striptease\" in 19th-century London. \"My work shows quite clearly that the mummy's curse concept predates Carnarvon's Tutankhamen discovery and his death by a hundred years,\" Montserrat told the Independent (U.K.) in an interview some years before his own death. Montserrat believed that a lively stage show in which real Egyptian mummies were unwrapped inspired first one writer, and subsequently several others, to pen tales of mummy revenge. The thread was even picked up by Little Women author Louisa May Alcott in her nearly unknown volume Lost in a Pyramid; or, The Mummy's Curse. \"My research has not only confirmed that there is, of course, no ancient Egyptian origin of the mummy's curse concept, but, more importantly, it also reveals that it didn't originate in the 1923 press publicity about the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb either,\" Montserrat stressed to the Independent. But Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo and a National Geographic Society grantee, believes the curse concept did exist in ancient Egypt as part of a primitive security system. She notes that some mastaba (early non-pyramid tomb) walls in Giza and Saqqara were actually inscribed with \"curses\" meant to terrify those who would desecrate or rob the royal resting place. \"They tend to threaten desecrators with divine retribution by the council of the gods,\" Ikram said. \"Or a death by crocodiles, or lions, or scorpions, or snakes.\" In recent years, some have suggested that the pharaoh's curse was biological in nature. Could sealed tombs house pathogens that can be dangerous or even deadly to those who open them after thousands of years\u2014especially people like Lord Carnarvon with weakened immune systems? The mausoleums house not only the dead bodies of humans and animals but foods to provision them for the afterlife. Lab studies have shown some ancient mummies carried mold, including Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus, which can cause congestion or bleeding in the lungs. Lung-assaulting bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus may also grow on tomb walls. These substances may make tombs sound dangerous, but scientists seem to agree that they are not. F. DeWolfe Miller, professor of epidemiology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, concurs with Howard Carter's original opinion: Given the local conditions, Lord Carnarvon was probably safer inside Tut's tomb than outside. \"Upper Egypt in the 1920s was hardly what you'd call sanitary,\" Miller said. \"The idea that an underground tomb, after 3,000 years, would have some kind of bizarre microorganism in it that's going to kill somebody six weeks later and make it look exactly like [blood poisoning] is very hard to believe.\" In fact, Miller said, he knows of no archaeologist\u2014or a single tourist, for that matter\u2014who has experienced any afflictions caused by tomb toxins. But like the movie mummies who invoke the malediction, the legend of the mummy's curse seems destined never to die.

Movie mummies are known for two things: fabulous riches and a nasty curse that brings treasure hunters to a bad end. But Hollywood didn't invent the curse concept. The \"mummy's curse\" first enjoyed worldwide acclaim after the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt. When Howard Carter opened a small hole to peer inside the tomb at treasures hidden for 3,000 years, he also unleashed a global passion for ancient Egypt. Tut's glittering treasures made great headlines\u2014especially following the opening of the burial chamber on February 16, 1923\u2014and so did sensationalistic accounts of the subsequent death of expedition sponsor Lord Carnarvon. In reality, Carnarvon died of blood poisoning, and only six of the 26 people present when the tomb was opened died within a decade. Carter, surely any curse's prime target, lived until 1939, almost 20 years after the tomb's opening. But while the pharaoh's curse may lack bite, it hasn't lost the ability to fascinate audiences\u2014which may be how it originated in the first place. The late Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat conducted a comprehensive search and concluded that the concept began with a strange \"striptease\" in 19th-century London. \"My work shows quite clearly that the mummy's curse concept predates Carnarvon's Tutankhamen discovery and his death by a hundred years,\" Montserrat told the Independent (U.K.) in an interview some years before his own death. Montserrat believed that a lively stage show in which real Egyptian mummies were unwrapped inspired first one writer, and subsequently several others, to pen tales of mummy revenge. The thread was even picked up by Little Women author Louisa May Alcott in her nearly unknown volume Lost in a Pyramid; or, The Mummy's Curse. \"My research has not only confirmed that there is, of course, no ancient Egyptian origin of the mummy's curse concept, but, more importantly, it also reveals that it didn't originate in the 1923 press publicity about the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb either,\" Montserrat stressed to the Independent. But Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo and a National Geographic Society grantee, believes the curse concept did exist in ancient Egypt as part of a primitive security system. She notes that some mastaba (early non-pyramid tomb) walls in Giza and Saqqara were actually inscribed with \"curses\" meant to terrify those who would desecrate or rob the royal resting place. \"They tend to threaten desecrators with divine retribution by the council of the gods,\" Ikram said. \"Or a death by crocodiles, or lions, or scorpions, or snakes.\" In recent years, some have suggested that the pharaoh's curse was biological in nature. Could sealed tombs house pathogens that can be dangerous or even deadly to those who open them after thousands of years\u2014especially people like Lord Carnarvon with weakened immune systems? The mausoleums house not only the dead bodies of humans and animals but foods to provision them for the afterlife. Lab studies have shown some ancient mummies carried mold, including Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus, which can cause congestion or bleeding in the lungs. Lung-assaulting bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus may also grow on tomb walls. These substances may make tombs sound dangerous, but scientists seem to agree that they are not. F. DeWolfe Miller, professor of epidemiology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, concurs with Howard Carter's original opinion: Given the local conditions, Lord Carnarvon was probably safer inside Tut's tomb than outside. \"Upper Egypt in the 1920s was hardly what you'd call sanitary,\" Miller said. \"The idea that an underground tomb, after 3,000 years, would have some kind of bizarre microorganism in it that's going to kill somebody six weeks later and make it look exactly like [blood poisoning] is very hard to believe.\" In fact, Miller said, he knows of no archaeologist\u2014or a single tourist, for that matter\u2014who has experienced any afflictions caused by tomb toxins. But like the movie mummies who invoke the malediction, the legend of the mummy's curse seems destined never to die."
